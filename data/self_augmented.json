How do you shut down a piece of unwanted advice, and what do you do to set boundaries with someone who's trying to help you but shouldn't be giving you advice? How do you stay out of arguments and leave unsolicited advice-givers in their place? Should you ever let an advice-giver think you left unsolicited advice unscathed to spare them feelings, or should you stand up for your personal boundaries? Let's cover your response as a neutral piece of advice in order to maximize its effectiveness.",
    "original_question": "How to respond to unsolicited advice?",
    "response": "When someone gives you unsolicited advice, it can be tricky to know how to respond, no matter how well-intentioned it is. You don't want to hurt their feelings, but you also may not want to leave room for further advice. Sometimes, all you can do is politely acknowledge the advice and move forward. In other cases, however, you may need to shut the advice-giver down for crossing a boundary, or even leave the conversation.\n\n## Keep your cool\n\n1. Try to remember that the person is probably just trying to be helpful. They may not realize when they overstep their bounds, and they might hope that you will genuinely benefit from their advice. Sometimes, unsolicited advice just means that the person cares about you and wants to make your life easier. It is easy to take unsolicited advice as criticism. While this can be true, take their perspective into account and try to see if they are offering genuine, yet misguided support.\n2. Take a moment to put yourself in the other person's shoes. While it does not excuse their rude behavior, keep in mind that people often give unsolicited advice because they feel the need to be heard, or because it's what they're used to receiving from other people. Think about what may have led this person to share a piece of advice you did not need. Some examples of experiences that might lead someone to give unsolicited advice are feeling unheard while growing up, going through a difficult time and projecting their own problems onto you, or they feel undermined in other areas of their life and give advice to feel more competent. In other cases, the person may feel more powerful by giving advice that no one asked for, or they may be overconfident in their abilities. Gender is another factor, as men tend to give women more unsolicited advice, often as a result of undervaluing their skills.\n3. Maintain a sense of humor. It’s often easiest to smile or laugh off unsolicited advice. By having a sense of humor about the situation, you can put yourself in the right frame of mind to shrug off the comment. For small, harmless suggestions, especially from strangers, put the situation in perspective and let your humor guide your response. Think about how the situation will make a funny story to tell your friends later, or how absurd it is for someone to think you might not know how to do a simple task. You can convey good-natured humor in your response out of politeness, even when you find the suggestion silly or ignorant. By saying something like, “Well, that’s a great idea! Why didn’t I think of that?” you may be enabling them to continue to offer unprompted advice, but it can help you avoid conflict.\n4. Avoid the impulse to lash out. It is easy to feel defensive when you receive unsolicited advice, in part because it can feel like the other person doesn’t trust you to handle things themselves. Sarcasm and criticism can make the person who gave you advice feel victimized, however, as they most likely won’t see what they did wrong. Think about your relationship with the person. Especially if they are a friend or family member, you may not want to upset them. When interacting with a stranger, it can be easy to be dismissive or rude, but try responding in a firm, yet polite way if laughing off the advice doesn’t work.\n\n\n## Move on with the conversation\n\n1. Hear the advice-giver out. In many cases, the person just wants to feel heard or contribute to the conversation. Let them say their piece, even if it's unhelpful or completely wrong. They'll probably feel better once they finish talking and often just stop. Once they have finished, the conversation can move on.\n2. Acknowledge the advice and move on. Sometimes the easiest thing to do is nod, smile, say okay, and go ahead with your plans anyway. Particularly if the person is in a position of power, you might feel obligated to thank them before moving forward or changing the subject. \"Thank you. I'll consider that.\" \"Let me write that down so I can think it over.\" \"I already have a plan for handling this, but thank you for your perspective. I'll take it into consideration.\"\n3. Turn it into a joke about yourself. A little humor can turn around an awkward situation. If you think of something silly to say, try saying it out loud. The two of you might be able to have a good laugh and move on. \"If you think my desk is messy, you should see my bedroom. Some of my clothes have probably fossilized by now.\" \"You know me. I love carbs far too much to change my diet.\" \"I would, but my husband banned me from the kitchen after the second time I set myself on fire.\"\n4. Address their motive, if they have one. Sometimes people who give advice have an ulterior motive (for better or for worse). If you can tell that an advice-giver is hoping you'll do something that makes them happy, try offering an alternative or addressing it directly. \"Are you trying to make an excuse to spend more time with me? Because you don't need one! Are you free this weekend?\" \"I know that it's been a big change since I moved away from home. I enjoy living in the city, so I plan to stay there. Why don't we set some dates for you to come visit?\"\n5. Ask a question to switch to a new topic. Changing the subject by asking a question can be a good way to distract a person who was piling on advice. Try asking about them, or about something you know they're interested in. This way, they're likely to stay engaged in the new topic. \"I'll keep that in mind. But enough about me. How was your day?\" \"My partner and I are going to make all our birthing decisions together. Do you know of any good parent and me classes?\" \"Thanks for the advice! You mentioned having two dogs. What are their names?\"\n6. Turn down the advice politely if the person doesn't get the hint.. Try to keep it positive by saying that it isn't right for you personally, while acknowledging that it could be right for them or someone else. This will help the other person realize that they gave advice you didn’t ask for. \"Thank you for trying to help, but I may have given the wrong impression. I'm not looking for advice right now.\" \"I've tried that, but I found that it doesn't help me personally.\" \"I'll make treatment decisions with my doctor.\" \"That's not in line with my personal values.\"\n\n\n## Confront the advice-giver\n\n1. Express your discomfort if the advice-giver crosses a line. Sometimes, people say things that are downright rude, mean, or overly familiar. In that case, you may want to tell them that they've offended you or hurt your feelings. Try to make \"I\" statements (e.g. \"I'm upset\") instead of a \"you\" statement (e.g. \"you're rude\") so that you don't put them on the defensive. One way to shut down a piece of unwanted advice would be to say, \"I feel upset about this line of conversation. Let's please change the subject.\"\n2. Set a boundary with a regular advice-giver. If someone is repeatedly trying to give advice when it's not what you want, you may want to express your frustration in a constructive way. You can set a boundary in the conversation, or in general, if the person has a track record of offering unsolicited advice. For a specific instance of needing to set a boundary you could say, \"I know you're trying to help, but I really just need a listening ear right now,\" or simply \"I'm not looking for advice at the moment.\" If someone has been giving you unsolicited advice for weeks, months, or years, try saying something like, “I often feel like you try to help in ways that show you don’t trust me to help myself,” or “I will ask for advice if I need to, but I need you to let me talk about this without trying to help.”\n3. Exit the conversation if needed. Sometimes people pile on unsolicited advice despite your attempts to redirect the conversation or set a boundary. In these situations, it may be easier to leave the conversation for a minute or end the conversation altogether. \"Please excuse me. I remembered… \"\n\t* \"I need to get going now so I'm not late.\" \"I need to get to an appointment. It was nice talking to you!\"\n",

As of jQuery 1.6, the ```.prop()```\nmethod provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while\n```.attr()``` retrieves attributes.&quot;\n&quot;Properties generally affect the dynamic state of a DOM element without\nchanging the serialized HTML attribute. Examples include the ```value```\nproperty of input elements, the ```disabled``` property of inputs and\nbuttons, or the ```checked``` property of a checkbox. The ```.prop()``` method\nshould be used to set ```disabled``` and ```checked``` instead of the ```.attr()```\nmethod. The ```.val()``` method should be used for getting and setting\n```value```.&quot; - jQuery documentation for prop()\n\nPre-jQuery 3.0 (before 2016)\nThe reason why you should use ```prop``` over ```removeAttr()``` is that ```removeAttr()``` completely removes the ```disabled``` attribute itself - as this method would simply set the corresponding property name to ```false```:\n\nPrior to jQuery 3.0, using .removeAttr() on a boolean attribute such\nas checked, selected, or readonly would also set the corresponding\nnamed property to false. This behavior was required for ancient\nversions of Internet Explorer but is not correct for modern browsers\nbecause the attribute represents the initial value and the property\nrepresents the current (dynamic) value. - jQuery 3.0 Breaking Changes\n\nWhile ```prop()``` merely sets the property's underlying boolean value to false.",

    "original_question": "How to clean slate?",
    "response": "Slate is a stone that brings natural beauty into the home, and can be expensive to install. Regular maintenance cleaning can help preserve slate. But sometimes, it needs a deep clean or stain removal. A combination of regular cleaning and an occasional deep clean can help keep your slate in good condition.\n\n## Maintain a regular clean routine\n\n1. Sweep or remove dust and debris regularly. If you have slate floors, it is important to sweep daily or several times a week. Dust can damage slate over time by wearing away the surface. Keeping a regular cleaning schedule can prevent this damage. Use a dry broom or cloth for this step.\n2. Mix a solution of mild soap and water. For this, you will need a large bucket full of warm water. Mix in a little bit of soap. Dish soap works well for this.\n3. Mop or wipe the surface. Gently wipe the surface of the slate using small circular motions. This motion will loosen and lift dried-on dust and dirt. Use a soft mop, made from materials such as a microfiber. Stiff bristles can damage the stone. For vertical surfaces, clean from the bottom up. Slate should be cleaned with soap every 2-3 months.\n4. Rinse the slate with water. Rinse out your bucket and mop first, and then use them to rinse the slate with water. Soap buildup can attract more dirt, meaning you will have to clean your slate again.\n5. Dry the slate with a fresh, dry, soft cloth. This will remove any streaks from forming on the slate that may occur from air drying and prevent slipping on floor surfaces.\n\n\n## Clean deeply\n\n1. Sweep and mop the slate. Start with removing dry dust and debris by sweeping. Then mop or wipe the slate surface with a soft cloth or microfiber mop in soapy water. Allow the surface to dry.\n2. Apply teak oil to the slate. After the surface is completely dry, apply teak oil to a clean, dry cloth. Using small, circular motions, apply cloth to the slate to cover it in a thin layer of teak oil. Designated slate oil is also available to buy at some hardware stores. However, it tends to be more expensive. Teak oil will achieve the same results.\n3. Clean grout between slate tiles. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. You can find hydrogen peroxide at hardware stores or pharmacies. Spray the solution onto the grout. Avoid direct contact with the eyes when using hydrogen peroxide. Repeat this step as needed if the grout doesn't look clean after the first round.\n4. Reapply sealant as needed. Sealant protects slate from some everyday wear and tear, and is used on interior surfaces. Each sealant is different, so be sure to follow the specific instructions that come with it. In general, apply at least two layers and allow the sealant to dry completely between coats. Each sealant will come with instructions about how often to reapply it.\n\n\n## Remove a stain\n\n1. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. Allow the mixture to sit for around 10 minutes.\n2. Spray the solution onto the stain and scrub. Using a soft-bristled brush or microfiber cloth, scrub the stain with small, circular motions. If the stain does not come out, a stronger solution may be needed.\n3. Mix a solution of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. Add a few spoonfuls of baking soda to the peroxide until the mixture becomes bubbly. Wait until the bubbles stop.\n4. Apply the solution to the stain. Once the peroxide and baking soda mix has set, you can wipe it away with a clean cloth.\n",

    "original_question": "I understand that unlocking the bootloader will wipe my Android phone, but have been looking around for why.  Seems to be by design, but what is the reasoning for that design?  Is it some security concern, some obscure technical reason, or just for lulz?  I'm looking for something solid to chew on here, something more than because \"that's how it is\".",
    "response": "It's a security concern. The Android documentation doesn't provide a lot of elaboration, stating simply:\n\n  The procedure must be confirmed on-screen, and deletes the user data for privacy reasons.\n\nHowever, the privacy concern is relatively straightforward to extrapolate. Once the bootloader is unlocked, the device can be flashed with unsigned images. This means that it is relatively trivial to root the device, and there are actually multiple ways it can be done, such as:\n\n* Flashing a system image with root tools built in\n* Flashing a boot image that runs ```adbd``` with root by default (an \"unsecure\" image)\n* Flashing a recovery image, then using that to overwrite the system or boot partitions with ones that allow root access\n\nOnce root is obtained, all of the information on ```/data``` essentially becomes accessible. This could be emails, contact information, or many other pieces of personal information that you likely don't want in the wrong hands. \n\nTherefore, it makes sense to wipe all of this data during the unlocking procedure to ensure that there is no off-the-shelf \"official\" way of bypassing the sandboxing restrictions implemented by the Android operating system, which would thereby allow someone to steal personal data.\n\nOf course, there may be ways to root without wiping on some devices, but they rely on exploits rather than official methods like a bootloader unlock, meaning they are basically bugs.",

    "original_question": "Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20°C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20°C (-4°F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.",
    "response": "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter.",

Queen Elizabeth II, the most famous living monarch, has been winked at by a U.S. president, among many other gaffes she's witnessed over the years. The royal family lives on, and the correct etiquette to use remains, at least in the British case, a suggested tradition rather than a requirement.\n\n## Address queen elizabeth ii in a letter\n\n1. Decide whether to use traditional forms. According to the Royal Family's official policy, you should be free to write in whatever style you like. Politeness and respect will make any letter more kindly received, but that does not necessarily equate to using formal terms. Stay sincere, and do not use the formal terms below if they make you uncomfortable.\n2. Begin the letter with \"Madam.\" At the top of your letter, write \"Madam,\" skip a line, and start writing your letter on the line below it. This is the formal and traditional term of address when writing a letter to the Queen of the United Kingdom.\n3. Conclude the letter with a respectful term. The traditional written conclusion is I have the honour to be, Madam, Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant, followed by your name. If you find this conclusion distasteful due to the declaration of servitude, or the insertion of the letter u in honour, consider one of the following respectful conclusions instead:\n\t* With greatest respect,\n\t* Yours faithfully,\n\t* Yours sincerely,\n4. Mail the letter. On the envelope, write the following postal address, using the last line only if you are mailing the letter from outside the UK:\n\t* The Queen\n\t* Buckingham Palace\n\t* London SW1A 1AA\n\t* United Kingdom\n\n\n## Address queen elizabeth ii in person\n\n1. Make a small curtsy, bow, or nod. Traditionally, women do a discreet curtsy and men bow from the neck when they meet the Queen of the United Kingdom. This is no longer required, but citizens of the Commonwealth usually choose to use this greeting. People who are not subjects of the Queen often prefer to use a slight nod instead. Do not bow from the waist.\n2. Politely shake the Queen's hand if offered. The Queen may or may not offer her hand, although there is no special significance to one decision or the other. If she does offer her hand, take it in a brief, gentle handshake. Do not offer your hand first.\n3. Wait for Her Majesty to address you. A good general rule, in fact, is not to initiate an action or conversation until the Queen has addressed you directly. Needless to say, wait until the Queen finishes speaking before you reply.\n4. Address her as \"Your Majesty\" the first time in the conversation. If you are stuck for words, say \"Hello, Your Majesty. I am delighted to meet you.\" Any polite greeting is acceptable, however.\n5. Address her as \"Ma'am\" for the rest of the conversation. For the rest of the conversation, say, \"Ma'am,\" pronounced to rhyme with \"jam.\" You may use the term \"Your Majesty\" again if you are asking her a question or introducing someone, but \"Ma'am\" will do most of the time.\n6. Don't ask personal questions. Most likely, the Queen will be guiding the conversation. But if you contribute your own small talk, avoid asking her about her family or personal life.\n7. Don't turn your back on the Queen until the conversation is over. Remain facing her or standing to the side throughout the conversation. Turn away or leave only when the conversation is over. And of course, don't forget to give her a proper good-bye and thank Her Majesty for the unexpected opportunity.\n\n\n## Address queen of other nations\n\n1. Try to find the specific form of address. Monarchies often have specific terms of address borne of their countries' traditions. Search online or in etiquette books for the terms of address for the specific monarchy.\n2. When in doubt, use \"Your Majesty.\" The term \"Your Majesty\" is common and unlikely to cause offense. This term is the proper way to address most queens, from Queen Pengiran Anak Saleha of Brunei, to Queen Mathilde of Belgium. Use \"Her Majesty\" instead of \"her\" when writing or speaking about these queens in the third person.\n3. Address Empresses as \"Her Imperial Majesty.\" If a monarch's title includes \"Empress,\" or if the nation she heads traditionally considers itself an empire, she should be addressed as \"Her Imperial Majesty.\"\n",

    "original_question": "I've rooted my phone.  Now what?  What do I gain from rooting?",
    "response": "In few words, rooting an Android system means overcome the limitations that were imposed over it by the manufacturer. People may want that for different reasons, but the main one is freedom. Having a rooted phone means you've got all the control over your device.\n\nThe main reason people root phones is to install a custom ROM. Custom ROMs are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer ROMs, like installing apps on sdcard or taking screenshots. Custom ROMS can also become a system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers. You can see a review of popular ROMS, as an example, here.\n\nRooting Android also allows you to uninstall stock apps that you don't use or don't want, besides those that violates user's privacy (see CarrierIQ). Another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage. A rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access. Those apps generally aim to do something that would not be possible without that privilege. A lot of useful apps were shown on the previous answer, but you may find a lot more available on Google Play. You can find a list of good apps here.",

    "generated_instruction": "How do i end homelessness?",
    "original_question": "How to help end homelessness?",
    "response": "Homelessness can feel like a daunting problem, especially as the population grows and living costs continue to rise. Helping to end homelessness will ensure no one has to go without a permanent, stable place to live. Give back to homeless organizations and participate in events that focus on ending homelessness. Advocating for changes to policies and laws around homelessness and treating homeless people with respect can also help to address this important issue.\n\n## Support homeless organizations and group\n\n1. Volunteer your time to a local homeless shelter. Start small by volunteering weekly or monthly at a homeless shelter in your area. Sign up to volunteer to serve food to the homeless or to create care packages for the homeless. You may challenge yourself to volunteer for 2-4 hours a week or twice a month. Or you may devote time during the holidays to work at a homeless shelter. Enlist friends or family to volunteer with you at a homeless shelter.\n2. Donate your skills to a non-profit organization that focuses on homelessness. Search for non-profit groups and organizations that work on initiatives for ending homelessness in your area. Contact them and offer to help them in any way you can. Put skills you already have to good use by donating them to the organization. For example, if you have coding skills, you may offer to update the organization’s website. Or if you love talking to people, you may offer to work in a call center or go door to door to promote the non-profit organization.\n3. Give monetary donations to homeless groups and organizations. Donating money to homeless organizations can go a long way to helping with this issue. You may give a large sum once a year to a specific program for the homeless or to the organization as whole. Regular giving, where you give a small amount once weekly or once a month, can also help. Donate to a homeless organization as a gift for a friend or in memory of someone close to you. Make a holiday donation to the organization as a way to give back. Raise money for these organizations by setting up a fundraiser online for them or by asking others for donations.\n4. Go to fundraisers for homeless organizations. Show your support for ending homelessness by attending fundraisers and events that address the issue. Check your local community board for events to raise funds for a local homeless shelter or drop in center. Find out if there are fundraisers in your area that you can donate time or money to. Donate an item for a silent auction at an event for the homeless. Bid on items to help raise money for the issue. Invite friends and family to fundraisers to benefit the homeless so they can participate as well.\n5. Participate in food and clothing drives for the homeless. Donate clothing or food for the drive. Volunteer to collect food and clothing for the drive. Promote the food and clothing drive on social media to get others to donate. Warm coats, socks, scarves, and hats are all good options for a clothing drive. Non-perishable food like canned goods, crackers, and granola bars are ideal donations for a food drive. Most communities will run annual food and clothing drives, especially around Christmas time when the weather is cold and homeless people need more support. Check your community board or at your community center for information on upcoming food or clothing drives. Your school or your church may also run a food and clothing drive for the homeless.\n\n\n## Advocate for homeless policies and laws\n\n1. Write or call your government representative about ending homelessness. Many long term solutions for homelessness require changes to existing policies and laws. Contact your representative in government and ask them what they are doing to help end homelessness. Remind them that homelessness is an important issue that their constituents care about and want to address. Search online for contact information for your government representative. Calling them directly will be more effective than writing a letter. Messaging them publicly on social media can also be effective. For example, you may write to your mayor or you may contact your senator. You can also reach out to city council members to find out how they plan to address the issue. In your letter or call, advocate for more investment in affordable housing and social services to help prevent homelessness. Discuss the need for services that help homeless people find permanent homes and stay off the street. Note the need for counseling and rehabilitation centers for homeless people with addiction issues so they can get better and find employment.\n2. Support political candidates that care about ending homelessness. Put your right to vote to work by only supporting candidates who discuss ending homelessness in their platforms and during their campaigns. Promote them on social media and volunteer for their campaign. Cast your vote for them on election day. Tell friends and family about political candidates who discuss ending homelessness so they can stay informed and vote.\n3. Organize a march or protest that focuses on support for the homeless. Let others know about this important issue by organizing a march or a peaceful protest that focuses on ending homelessness. Invite friends, family members, and colleagues to the march. Promote the march or protest on social media so others can participate. Make signs that note the importance of ending homelessness and bring them to the march. Use a megaphone at the protest to give speeches about the issue. Have the march or protest in a public space, such as in front of a government building or in a public square.\n4. Work towards a career as a politician, lobbyist, or non-profit worker. Do well in your social studies and history classes in high school. Join a school debate team or public speaking club to get better at these skills. Take classes in political science, history, and conflict resolution in university. Get involved in local politics and non-profit organizations. Apply to positions as a lobbyist or a non-profit worker so you can work to actively end homelessness on a day to day basis. Run for local office with a platform that focuses on ending homelessness in your community.\n\n\n## Treat homeless people with respect\n\n1. Acknowledge the homeless person with a smile or nod. Rather than rushing by them without looking at them, make eye contact and smile or nod at them. Let them know that you see them and acknowledge them as a person. This is a small way for you to show empathy for them. Avoid yelling, shouting, or mocking the homeless person, as this will only make them feel more alienated and alone. Treat them like a friend or family member, showing care and respect for them.\n2. Try starting a conversation with the homeless person. Ask them how they are doing. Find out where they are from. Keep the conversation open and friendly. Maintain eye contact when you talk to them so they know you care. For example, you may say, “How are you today?” or “Where are you from originally?”\n\t* If the homeless person does not seem interested in answering your questions, don’t pressure them into answering. Let them decide if they want to engage with you on a deeper level.\n3. Offer to buy the homeless person a meal. If you have the time and funds, offer to grab the person a cup of coffee or a sandwich from somewhere nearby. Getting the person a warm meal may make their day and help them feel less down about their situation. The meal does not have to be elaborate or expensive. A cup of coffee or a small snack would likely be appreciated by the person.\n4. Give the homeless person a care package. Prepare a care package that contains important items like socks, warm gloves, toothpaste, lip balm, and non-perishable food like crackers or nuts. Give out the care packages to homeless people in your area so they have supplies that they need. Make it a habit to hand out care packages to homeless people once a month or regularly during the winter months.\n5. Decide to give the person money if you feel comfortable. Giving money to a homeless person is a personal preference and completely up to you. Handing change or a few bucks to a homeless person can be a demonstration of empathy and help them in a very direct way. You may decide to give the person a meal, rather than money. Or you may sometimes give the person money and offer them food other times.\n",

Discuss vaccination recommendations with your vet for your kitten.\n12. Start looking for kitten-proof home. You have to look for homes that will accommodate your kittens (at least 6 and sometimes 12).

    "original_question": "How to take care of kittens?",
    "response": "## Help your female cat give birth and care for newborns (0 to 4 weeks)\n\n1. Provide a quiet place for the birth. Your female cat will chose a place where she feels safe to give birth. By all means, provide a large cardboard box, turn it on its side and line it with warm, dry bedding–but don't be disappointed if she has other ideas. Instinct tells her to find a quiet concealed spot, such as under a bed, behind a sofa, or inside a kitchen cabinet. To learn more about helping your cat give birth, see this article.\n2. Do not disturb during the birth and first two days. The first 48 hours is a crucial time for the mother to bond with her kittens, so try not to disturb her. If she gives birth under your bed, leave her there. Moving the newborn kittens will distress the mother and in the worst scenario could cause her to reject them. Once she is firmly bonded, at around four or five days, if you feel it's necessary to move the kittens, do it then.\n3. Leave food, water, and cat litter in the room. The mother won't want to leave her kittens for long in the first two weeks of their life. Always put food and water within stretching distance of her nest, and if possible, offer a litter tray in the same room so that she can stay within sight and sound of the kittens. If food is in another room, some mothers chose to starve rather than leave their newborn kittens to find it.\n4. Feed the mother extra calories. She needs the extra calories to make milk for her kittens. Feed her kitten food, which has more calories than adult cat food.\n5. Let Mom do most of the clean-ups. Instinct helps the mother to keep the nest clean. The newborn kittens do not urinate or defecate on their own, so the mother has to lick their bottoms before and after feeding to stimulate elimination. This way she keeps the nest clean. Try to disturb the nest as little as possible. If the bedding becomes soiled, wait until Mom hops out for a toilet break herself to take out the dirty bedding and pop in clean.\n6. Check that the kittens are all nursing. If the mother cat is present, the kittens should nurse from her immediately after the last kitten is born. Newborn kittens will spend most of their time sleeping, waking up to nurse every two to three hours. If they do not appear to be nursing, or one kitten is being pushed away from the mother cat by its siblings, supplement with bottle feeding as described in Part 2.\n7. Consider spaying the mother cat. Having your mother cat spayed (removing her womb) after the kittens are done nursing (they should be weaned by about 8 weeks) is highly recommended by veterinarians and humane organizations. This helps prevent the suffering of unwanted kittens, and can also have some health benefits for the spayed cat. Be aware that a cat can potentially fall pregnant again as little as three to four days after giving birth, so keep her indoors to avoid this risk.\n8. Start to think about deworming the kittens. This can happen as early as two weeks if necessary. Consult a veterinarian for proper medication and dosing.\n\n\n## Care for orphan kitten (0 to 4 weeks)\n\n1. Feed the kittens a milk replacement. Powdered cat milk replacer (such as Cimicat) can be purchased from the vet clinic, major pet stores, or on the Internet. Another good milk replacer is KMR. This is the cat equivalent of infant formula, with the same composition as queen's (mother's) milk. The milk replacer has guidelines as to how much to feed in each meal. Do not feed cow's milk to the kitten as the lactose is likely to upset the kitten's stomach. If you have no milk replacement and a hungry kitten, offer some cooled boiled water in a dropper or syringe until you can get to the vet clinic or pet store. The water keeps the kitten hydrated and won't upset her tummy.\n2. Use a kitten feeding bottle with a specially designed kitten teat. You can purchase this at a vet clinic, a major pet store, or on the Internet. In an emergency use an eyedropper or a small syringe to drip the milk replacement into the kitten's mouth.\n3. Burp the kittens after each meal. You do this much as you would a baby: hold the kitten up straight against your shoulder, or place one hand under its belly. Gently pat and rub its back.\n4. Stimulate the kittens to eliminate. Before and after each feed, wipe the kitten's bottom with a paper towel or gauze pad soaked in warm water. This stimulates the kitten to go to the toilet, which otherwise she would not do. Hold the kitten over a litter box and use the towel to rub the kitten's genitals and anal region after every meal. Continue to do this until the urination and defecation is over (when nothing else is coming out). Rub in just one direction–rubbing back and forth is irritating. Cotton balls or pads are not recommended because they shed.\n5. Look for signs of healthy elimination. Urine should be pale yellow and odorless, and stools should be yellowish-brown, formed in tiny logs. Dark, pungent urine is a sign of dehydration; green stool may be a sign of over-feeding, while white stool could indicate malabsorption, a serious problem. Call your vet if you have any concerns. If the kitten does not urinate for 12 hours, take her to the vet's immediately. Most kittens poop once a day, but individual schedules vary. Take her to the vet's if she hasn't pooped in more than two days.\n6. Follow the kittens' meal times. In the first two weeks of life the kitten feeds every two to three hours around the clock. The kitten will tell you she is hungry by crying and wriggling around as if hunting for a nipple. A full kitten often falls asleep while suckling and has a rounded belly. After two weeks, the feeds can be stretched out to to every three to four hours, with a gap of six hours overnight.\n7. Keep the kittens warm with a covered heating pad. Neonatal kittens (under two weeks of age) cannot regulate their body temperature and usually keep warm by snuggling up to their mother. You can simulate this situation by keeping them on a heated pad designed for puppies or kittens. Avoid putting them in direct contact with the pad: if the kitten is in direct contact with the heat pad, she might be at risk of either local burns or overheating. However, these pads usually come in a fleece cover so it shouldn't be a problem, except for when you remove the cover for washing, in which case substitute a towel. As the kitten gets older (over two weeks), she is able to move away from the heat if she gets too hot.\n8. Never feed a cold kitten. If a kitten's body feels cold, you need to warm her up gradually. A kitten is cold if her ears and/or the pads of her feet feel chilly to the touch. Put your finger in her mouth: if it feels cold, the kitten's body temperature is too low, which can be life-threatening. Warm her up slowly by wrapping her in a fleece blanket and holding her next to your body, rubbing her gently with your hands for one to two hours.\n9. Learn more about taking care of orphaned kittens. You can start with this article. Contact a veterinarian for information and suggestions. Your vet can also provide vaccinations against common diseases and deworm the kittens. Orphaned kittens may be dewormed starting at two weeks, and, depending on their situation, can be vaccinated starting anywhere from two to eight weeks. They may have weaker immune systems because, unlike other kittens, they don't get the antibodies from their mother's milk.\n\n\n## Wean and socialize your kitten (4 - 8 weeks)\n\n1. Start to leave out extra kitten food. If Mom's around, the weaning process (switching from mother's milk to solid food) happens naturally from about four weeks. At this point, Mom gets tired of the kittens chewing on her teats and starts to spend time apart from them. In turn, the hungry kittens investigate food options around them and usually discover Mom's food. As the kittens start to take mouthfuls of her food, they begin the weaning process.\n2. Provide water. Kittens do not need water until they start weaning, roughly around four weeks old. Any kitten above this age, however, should have constant access to a full water bowl. Change this water whenever it gets dirty (as it tends to if kittens step and/or poop in the bowl).\n3. Put down kitten food for hand-reared kittens. If you've been bottle-feeding the kittens yourself, the weaning process is similar. It sometimes helps to put some milk-replacer in a saucer and put your finger just beneath the surface to teach the kitten to lap first. Then, it's a matter of mashing up some wet kitten food with the milk-replacer to make a porridge for the kitten to lap. As she gets the hang of that you can thicken up the porridge until she's happily taking most of her calories in solid form.\n4. Socialize your kittens by introducing them to new things. Socialization is crucial during the three-to-nine-week window. From two to three weeks of age, handle the kittens as much as possible every day. Introduce them to different sights and sounds, such as the vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, men with beards, children . . . anything you can think of. During this six-week window the kitten is most open to new experiences, and what she encounters now she will accept without question as an adult, making her into a happy, well-adjusted and sociable cat. Use cat toys, balls, string, or other objects to play with them, but don't use objects small enough for them to swallow. (Note that cats may eat string or yarn if left unsupervised, so only allow this in your interactive play. It's a potential choking hazard.) Don't teach your kittens that human fingers and hands are toys, or the kitten may continue to bite and scratch them as an adult.\n5. Provide non-clumping litter. Choose a spot for the litter box carefully, as once used to it, the kittens will probably continue to use that spot. If litter-training the kittens yourself, simply place the kittens there after each meal, or whenever a kitten starts to crouch and scratch the floor in preparation for pooping. Clean the litter box at least once a day, or the kittens may stop using it. Choose a box with low sides so it's easy for the kittens to get in and out. Avoid clumping litter, as kittens may eat the clumps, which could potentially harm their digestion. If a kitten seems like it doesn't want to stay in the litter box, gently take its paws and imitate digging in the litter. Then, provide the kitten with privacy so it can dig a hole, do its business, and cover it up with some litter.\n6. Keep the cat inside until it has all its shots. Once your veterinarian allows it, you can let the cat outside to explore. Make sure you keep a close watch on it until you're sure it knows to return home. Let the kitten outside when it's a bit hungry. Entice it back in by calling its name and showing it food. This will remind your kitten that while outdoors is fun, its final destination will always be your home.\n7. Give kittens away responsibly. If selling or giving away the kittens, you should wait until they are at least eight weeks old, but twelve weeks old is preferred. Take them to a vet and start their shots before they leave you. Always follow-up with the new owners to make sure the kitten is getting her shots and is scheduled to be spayed or neutered. Exchange phone numbers with the new owners so you can confirm your kitten is in good hands, or in case the owners want to return her (at least you can help her find another home).\n\n\n## Take care of an adopt kitten (8 weeks and beyond)\n\n1. Ask the breeder or shelter for a blanket that smells like the kitten's mother and siblings. These smells help to give the kitten comfort while she settles into her new home.\n2. Ask what kind of food the kitten's been eating. Provide this for the first few days so that you don't make too many changes at once. When the kitten has settled in, this is your chance to change her food to one of your choosing, though do it gradually: replace a small quantity of her former food with the new food, increasing the amount slowly over the course of a week. If the kitten is eating dry kibble, leave a bowl out all day. If she is eating wet food, give her small meals every six hours. Continue to feed kitten food, not adult cat food, until one year of age.\n3. Provide water. Kittens above four weeks of age need water, so clean water should always be available. Cats tend to be more interested in water that is not next to their food bowl. Encourage drinking by placing water bowls in different spots through the house.\n4. Introduce the kitten to your house slowly. Expose the kitten to just one room initially: the whole house will be too overwhelming on the first day. Set up a bed (preferably one that has sides and a roof so the kitten feels safe in a nest), with food and water in one corner of the room, and a litter tray in the opposite corner. Show the kitten where her facilities are, and then leave her to rest. It's been a big day for the little kitten so let her adjust and sleep for a few hours.\n5. Give the kitten as much attention as you can. Spend as much time as possible grooming, playing, fussing and interacting with the kitten. This helps her to grow into a well-socialized, friendly adult.\n6. Keep the kitten and your possessions safe. Keep electrical cords and devices out of the kitten's reach to avoid her chewing on them. Child locks may be a wise investment for low cabinets if you have a particularly inquisitive kitten.\n7. Plan a vet visit. At nine weeks old the kitten can have her first vaccination. This is the ideal time for a vet to examine her, worm her and start vaccinations. The basic kitten vaccine includes protection against cat flu and infectious enteritis. There is also the option to vaccinate against feline leukemia.\n",

    "original_question": "How to be organized during the holidays?",
    "response": "## Personal holiday organization\n\n1. Plan for sleep. One of the dangers of the holiday season is that you schedule too much and don't budget enough time for sleep and exercise. These 2 practices can cut your stress level in half and make it easier to stay on task during your holiday rush. It is common to reduce your exercise time slightly during the holidays, but try to get about 30 minutes of mid-intensity cardiovascular exercise 5 times per week. Don't not cut down on your sleep; aim for 8 hours per night. Moderate your alcohol intake. Although it may seem like a sedative, it can actually prevent you from getting deep sleep. Stop after a few drinks to avoid losing your energy the next day.\n2. Set a budget 2 months before the holidays. Take into account how much you can afford and then split the money between cards, postage stamps, gifts, decorations, clothing, food and even a party. Plan an overage of 10 percent in your budget. This means all of your needs should add up to 90 percent of the money you have for the holidays.\n3. Sit down with your family 6 weeks before the holiday and ask for help. If you love control, this may be hard to do; however, it will take a load off your shoulders and make everyone feel like the holidays don't come together magically.\n4. Discuss the possibility of doing a low-gift giving Christmas or a charity project with your family. If your budget is tight, then giving 1 present or buying 1 big present for the whole family might be better. Studies have also shown that charity projects can help your emotional health during stressful times.\n5. Book travel plans 3 or more months before the holidays. Ticket prices tend to go up right before the holidays. Make sure you have lower travel costs and less stress associated with travel if you and your children or parents have their plans figured out in advance.\n6. Use a calendar that everyone can see, online or in the house. Place all commitments, deadlines, family nights and tasks on it so that everyone can refer back to it over the month of December.\n\n\n## Holiday shop organization\n\n1. Schedule shopping intelligently rather than in blocks. The following are good tips that make holiday shopping more effective and quick:\n\t* Buy things throughout the year, whenever you see something that is ideal for someone. You provide more thoughtful gifts if they are catered to the person, rather than bought frantically the month before. Store your gifts in 1 place in your house and come back to your gift hiding place 6 weeks before Chanukah or Christmas. Take a few hours off work during mid-week once the holiday sales start. You will miss the rush and have a more calm shopping experience. Shop in small spurts online. Getting online for hours can be a waste of time. Keep a list in your purse of things you are looking for, and add to it. Wait until you have 2 or 3 things you know you want to search for and do your power shopping. Open 3 browser tabs and compare prices on Amazon, Overtock.com and a Google Shopping page. Don't be afraid to give gift certificates. Many stores, massage parlors, movie theaters and more provide gift certificates. Think of something that your friends or family will find truly valuable over a product you are unsure they will like.\n2. Set up a wrapping station on a table in late November or early December. Wrap gifts as soon as you bring them home. This will remove the chance that children will find their gifts and it will allow you to get both shopping and wrapping done at a slow and steady pace.\n3. Aim to finish your shopping and wrapping by December 15th. Schedule your time accordingly, so that you can enjoy the holidays and be ready for any last-minute changes.\n\n\n## Holiday cook organization\n\n1. Clean your kitchen from top to bottom before attempting holiday baking or cooking. Try to do this in late November or early December. Rearrange things that overnight guests will need, such as coffee and cereal, in an easy to reach cupboard and create a baking cupboard.\n2. Stock up on baking supplies early in the season. Buy flour, sugar and spices at warehouse stores so that you don't have to make late night runs to the supermarket. Buy some pre-made pie crusts and cookies to keep around in case you don't have time to do everything from scratch.\n3. Bake throughout the holiday season. Clear out your freezer, and then create a cooking to do list that allows you to make and freeze items every week. For example, bake 1 sweet, such as cookies or candy, and prepare 1 side dish in preparation. Cover and label the dishes very well before you stack them on a freezer. For example, \"Sweet Potatoes. Thaw and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.\"\n4. Plan a holiday potluck party instead of baking all of the food. This is a great way to lower your budget and have fun. Allow people to bring desserts, side dishes or relish to family dinners as well; they understand your kitchen is very full.\n",

But with no evidence, no body, no name of a missing person, they can't even be held after the holding period for investigatory purposes expires. \n\nIf the video shows them committing assault, or breaking and entering (there actually are idiots who post this stuff), the video is actual evidence of a crime and it is often used against them. The statements can be used to begin an investigation, but people don't usually confess to anything worth pursuing even an investigation. The fact that someone says they used to do something criminal is not enough. For all you ( meaning anyone ) knows, the statute of limitations has expired because they \"pirated games\" 10 years ago.

These latter general ensemble methods allow you to leverage the power of a base classifier, either built-in or, of greater utility when exploring performance improvements, of your own design. This limits significantly the potential for creating novel methods within the existing machine learning framework. \nMathematica's strengths lay with it's expressive, compact, language, strong visualisation capabilities and easy parallelization.

    "response": "The difference between ```--save``` and ```--save-dev``` may not be immediately noticeable if you have tried them both on your own projects.

So since you passed ```await``` an array (of Promise objects) here instead of a Promise, the value returned by await is simply that array, which is of type ```Promise[]```.\nWhat you probably want to do is call ```Promise.all``` on the array returned by ```map``` in order to convert it to a single Promise before ```await```ing it.\nAccording to the MDN docs for ```Promise.all```:\n\nThe ```Promise.all(iterable)``` method returns a promise that resolves\nwhen all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or\nrejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.\n\nSo in your case:\n```var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar results: number[] = await Promise.all(arr.map(async (item): Promise => {\n    await callAsynchronousOperation(item);\n    return item + 1;\n}));\n```\nThis will resolve the specific error you are encountering here.\nDepending on exactly what it is you're trying to do you may also consider using ```Promise.allSettled```, ```Promise.any```, or ```Promise.race``` instead of ```Promise.all```, though in most situations (almost certainly including this one) ```Promise.all``` will be the one you want.",

    "generated_instruction": "why do you need semicolon after int i, *pi, *ppi?",
    "original_question": "In general, there are two types of syntax of defining functions - Something like C, C++, C#, or Java (```int functionName(char arg)```) vs the ML (and others) tradition of defining the return type after the function (and using something like a ```fun``` keyword to define a function - like ```fun functionName(char arg): int```).\nOne of the advantages (for the parser, at least) for a ```fun``` keyword is that it lets the parser be context-free (it doesn't have to guess if ```int``` defines a variable or if it defines a function).\nWhen C was invented, computers had very little memory and speed (so little, that the reason C requires one to define all the variables in the beginning of the function was because it had to be a one-pass parser). Why didn't they choose the simple way out and use function defining keyword?",
    "response": "Dennis Ritchie’s paper on The Development of the C Language gives some idea of the reasoning behind this: namely, the fundamental rule in C that declaration syntax should match expression syntax\"\n\nFor each object of such a composed type, there was already a way to mention the underlying object: index the array, call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer. Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear. Thus,\n```int i, *pi, **ppi;\n```\ndeclare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a pointer to an integer. The syntax of these declarations reflects the observation that ```i```, ```*pi```, and ```**ppi``` all yield an ```int``` type when used in an expression. Similarly,\n```int f(), *f(), (*f)();\n```\ndeclare a function returning an integer, a function returning a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning an integer;\n```int *api[10], (*pai)[10];\n```\ndeclare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to an array of integers. In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of the declaration.\n\n\nIt appears this rule trumped parser considerations. Its immediate consequence is that function declarations can’t use specific keywords, or impose a different ordering of declaration components.\nIt’s worth noting that parsing was somewhat different in early C, since function declarations didn’t specify their arguments, and function definitions separated the argument list from the argument declarations (which weren’t necessary for ```int``` arguments):\n```sum();\n```\ndeclares a ```sum``` function, which would then be defined as\n```sum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n(no types needed here, the default is ```int```). So the parser didn’t deal with types inside argument lists.",

    "original_question": "How to know what to charge for babysitting?",
    "response": "Babysitting is a great way to earn money and get experience taking care of children, but figuring out how much to charge for your time can be tricky. Many babysitters don’t have much work experience, and they feel bad asking for money. Remember, your time is valuable and you deserve to be paid fairly! Figure out a good base rate by talking with babysitters and parents in your area. You can also use an online babysitting rate calculator. Then charge more based on how many children you’re sitting, their needs, your skills, and your transportation costs.\n\n## Set a base rate\n\n1. Ask other babysitters you know what they charge. If you know anybody else who babysits, ask them what they charge. Once you have multiple opinions, you can see what the average is. Since they live in your area, they’ll know what a reasonable rate is for where you live. Different areas have very different rates, depending on what people’s average income is. Ask a fellow babysitter, “I’m a new babysitter and am trying to figure out what to charge. I was wondering how much you charge per hour?”\n\t* Major cities and their suburbs generally pay higher rates than small towns. In New York City and L.A., sitters charge about $20 an hour, while in Houston and Chicago they charge $15.\n2. Use an online rate calculator. The internet has a lot of babysitting rate calculators that allow you to put in your zip code and how many years of babysitting experience you have. It will calculate the average rate. One example is https://www.care.com/babysitting-rates.\n3. Ask parents you know what they pay for babysitters. Ask trusted adults in your area how much they pay their babysitters. This will help you get an idea of how much people are willing to pay. Once you have an idea, propose it to your client, and see if they think it’s fair. Keep in mind that parents will pay more per hour for a qualified nanny than for a teenage babysitter. Parents will also pay differently for full-time babysitting than for occasional nights or weekends.\n4. Look up what the minimum wage is in your area. Too many babysitters settle for less than minimum wage because they’re not sure what it is, or because the job is less official than jobs that require work permits. Counties and cities calculate the minimum wage based on what they think is a fair amount to give someone for an hour of their time, so you should charge at least that. If you’re underage to work at a regular job or are undocumented, you should still ask for the minimum wage. You deserve to be paid fairly.\n\n\n## Increase your base rate\n\n1. Increase your rate when you gain experience and qualifications. The more babysitting experience you have, the more skilled and qualified you are. Also, the older you are, the more you can charge. Increase your rate when you pass big milestones like graduating middle school or high school. Charge more if you have extra skills, like CPR certification or camp counselor experience.\n2. Charge more if there are more children. Once you’ve settled on a reasonable base rate, charge more money (maybe 5 dollars more per hour) for each additional child you’re asked to look after. Watching 1 or 2 children is very different from watching 5 children, so make sure you’re comfortable with it before saying yes to the job. Also, consider asking your client if you can bring a co-babysitter along with you for large groups of children. The client should pay both babysitters a reasonable rate for this to be a fair deal.\n3. Charge more for special needs and skills. If the child you’re being asked to watch is an infant who requires constant supervision, diaper changing, and bottles, you can charge more than if you’re watching a 10 year old. If the child has special needs or is particularly rambunctious or difficult to manage, you should also charge more, because you will have specialized skills to take care of them. Offer the price you think is fair considering the amount of physical and emotional energy that goes into caring for that child.\n4. Increase your rate if they ask you to do extra chores. You should feel free to charge more if your client asks you to do household chores like sweeping, mopping, dishes, laundry, grocery shopping, and cooking. You can also charge more if they ask you to care for their pets or help their children with their homework. The more tasks they ask you to do outside of just watching their child, the more you can charge for your hourly rate.\n5. Factor in transportation. If you have to travel a long time to get to your babysitting job, you should charge for your commute. Talk to your client about ways to do this. You can include your commute-time in the amount of time you’re compensated for. Another way is to have your client pay for your gas money or your bus tickets, depending on how you are getting there. If you have to bike or walk to your babysitting job in the dark, make sure you feel safe. Otherwise, you should refuse the job, or ask for different hours. Don’t accept a ride from an unfamiliar babysitting client. It may not be safe.\n6. Ask for more payment for babysitting on holidays. If your client asks you to work on Christmas, Valentine’s Day, New Year’s Eve, or some other special occasion, you should charge more. First of all, you’re giving up having a fun time, and you should only do that for the big bucks. And secondly, the client will be willing to pay more, because it’s hard to find sitters on nights like that. On the other hand, if you’re babysitting in the middle of a Sunday afternoon, you’ll probably get less money than babysitting on a Saturday night, when your clients want to go on a date night.\n",

If your carpet is unnaturally thick...\n\n## Magnet Method\nTake a powerful magnet (like a bar magnet, hardware stores - fridge magnets might work) and run it over the surface where you think the screw is. You should find it. If that still fails...\n\n## Vacuum Method\nTake a good vacuum cleaner. Put a sock over the extending arm, and run it over where you think the screw is. The sock will prevent the screw from being vacuumed up, but it will be stuck to the sock. There will still be enough suction to pick up the screw, even with the sock. If not, get a new vacuum! If that fails...\n\n## Organize your screws\nThere are many useful tools to organize screws. Go to your local RadioShack and get one, or make one out of a magnet for that awesome lifehack feel.\n\n## Stop using carpet!\n[Not a &quot;find your screws&quot; method - a tip about not frying your computer]\nCarpet can cause static discharge, which is very very very bad for a computer (personal experience). Work on a hard floor with an antistatic strap to reduce the chance of frying your PC.",

    "original_question": "How to get around st. louis on the cheap?",
    "response": "Whether you're traveling around St. Louis on vacation, visiting the area on business or live in the metro area, there are several ways to get around St. Louis on the cheap. The city's bus, train or van metro system are among the cheapest ways to get around. Another good note is that if you're visiting the dowtown STL area during the week, there are often \"City Guide\" personnel roaming (either on bike or foot), that will assist with any directions.\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Use St. Louis area maps to make getting around easier and cheaper. The St. Louis Convention and Visitor's Commission offers several downtown, metro and area maps that can help you plan your visit.\n2. Use the trip planner on the St. Louis Metro Transit website to plan the easiest and least costly routes around the city. The planner can help you choose between taking a taxi, the MetroBus or MetroLink train.\n\n\n## Ride the metrolink\n\n1. Purchase MetroLink tickets at vending machines in MetroLink stations. You can buy tickets or weekly and monthly passes with cash or a credit card. You can also purchase passes at the downtown St. Louis MetroRide store or online at the St. Louis Metro website. Buy either a 1-hour, 2-hour or 1-day pass for the MetroLink system. Two-hour and day passes also give you access to the MetroBus system while traveling in St. Louis. Passes start at just $2 for adults.\n2. Choose which MetroLink line you need to take to reach your destination. The MetroLink operates a Red Line between the Lambert Airport in Missouri and the Shiloh-Scott Station in Illinois. The Blue Line operates between the Shrewsbury-Lansdowne I-44 stop in Missouri and a station in Fairview Heights, Illinois.\n\n\n## Ride the metrobus\n\n1. Plan a MetroBus route. You can travel from Illinois to Missouri via MetroBus routes. The system's stops include many of the city's major attractions, like the civic center, Laclede's Landing and Busch Stadium. Use the MetroBus schedule to help find the best route to your destination before purchasing your tickets. Some routes may be quickest and less expensive if you combine a ride on the MetroBus with the MetroLink.\n2. Pay your MetroBus fare with exact change as you board, or purchase a MetroBus pass or tickets ahead of time at the MetroRide store in downtown St. Louis or online. If you'll be using both MetroLink and MetroBus, consider buying a combo fare pass at the store to save money.\n\n\n## Use the metro call-a-ride service\n\n1. Call for door-to-door transportation service in many areas of the city through the Metro Call-a-ride program. The service is available as a link to the MetroBus or MetroLink services, or from other designated locations. Call-a-Ride rates start at $13.\n2. Consider using the Metro Call-A-Ride if you or anyone in your party has a disability. The ride program is available for those who qualify for the Americans With Disabilities Act at a reduced rate starting at $4.\n3. Call 314-652-3617 or toll free 888-652-3617, up to a week in advance to reserve curb-side service from Metro Call-A-Ride. You can make reservations the day you travel, but Call-a-Ride cannot guarantee you space.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "How can I wear my long coat in a variety of styles? I am planning to add it on top of a dressy outfit for a formal occasion and dressing it down for casual daily wear as well.",
    "original_question": "How to wear long coats?",
    "response": "A long coat is a nice item to have in any closet, especially for people living in colder climates. There is a variety of styles of long coats as well as ways you can wear them. Make your long coat work for you by finding a style that fits you, dressing it down for casual daily wear, or adding it on top of a dressy outfit for a formal occasion.\n\n## Choose the right coat\n\n1. Try a fit-and-flare coat for the illusion of a thinner waist. For a long coat that hides a thick waist, try a fit-and-flare style. These coats fit tighter around the waist and then flare out at the hips. The tops are often double-breasted, and there are strategically placed seams on them to create a thinner look. Solid black and vertical stripes also make people look thinner. Experiment with these colors if you’re concerned about making your waist look thinner.\n2. Balance out wide hips with a voluminous collar on your coat. If you’d like to create the illusion of smaller hips, choose a coat that has a large collar such as a shawl collar or large faux-fur collar. The volume of the collar will draw attention away from the bottom half of your coat.\n3. Add curves to a narrow frame with a belted coat. Belts add dimension to long, straight coats. Look for a long coat with a thick wrap-around belt if you’d like to make your thin frame look curvier. Subtle pleats around the waist also help to add curves. Colors and patterns that add dimension for a thin person include light colors and plaid.\n4. Hide a rounder belly with a full-length men’s coat. Most younger men today wear knee-length long coats, but that length looks best on trim men who can wear a more form-fitting coat. Full-length coats go past the knee to the mid-calf, and are nice for disguising a heavier figure. Full-length coats are also considerably warmer, so they are ideal for cold climates.\n5. Go with a double-breasted knee-length coat if you’re petite. Long coats can easily swallow up a short person. A way to solve this is to keep the coat around knee-length or just past your knees. Double-breasted coats with a large envelope collar keep a proportioned look to a longer coat worn on a petite person. If you are of an average or taller height, you can easily pull off full-length coats that go past the knee to your mid-calf or below.\n6. Do the hug test to make sure the coat isn’t too small. It’s easy to buy a long coat that’s too small because the length of the coat may make you think it fits you. To check, try the coat on and wrap your arms around yourself, trying to touch the opposite shoulder with each hand. If the coat feels really tight in the shoulders or elbows, you should go with the next size up. You can also check the sleeve length by holding your arms straight out in front of you. If the sleeves go up 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) past your wrists, you probably need the next size up. The sleeve end should fall within 1 in (2.5 cm) of you wrist when your arms are up, and go almost to your knuckles when they are down.\n7. Check that the shoulder seams line up with your shoulders. On a properly fitting coat, the shoulder seams should line up with your shoulders. If they go down near your biceps, the coat is either too big or it is supposed to have an oversized shape to it. Either try on the next size down, or confirm that oversized is the style that you’re going for. Consider getting a coat tailored for you if cannot find a coat that fits correctly across your chest and shoulders as well as the length of your arms.\n8. Choose a wool coat for the longest winter wear. Long coats come in a variety of fabrics, but if you’re planning to wear your coat for a long time during the winter, invest in 100% wool or a wool-cashmere blend. Coats made with all cashmere tend to show wear much faster. If you intend to wear your jacket in fall, spring, or summer weather, you have more options for fabric, including cotton and twill.\n\n\n## Wear a long coat casually\n\n1. Wear a black coat with ripped jeans and sneakers for a go-anywhere look. Long black coats are versatile because they can be casual or formal. Pair yours with ripped blue or black skinny jeans, a fitted graphic T-shirt, and your favorite sneakers. Plain white sneakers are a popular classic with this look, but you can experiment with vintage, black and white, or skate style sneakers to individualize the style.\n2. Pair baggy trousers with an oversized maxi coat and sunglasses for comfort. If you’re looking to stay both comfortable and warm this winter, wear baggy black trousers rolled at the ankles with a cozy V-neck shirt under any color oversized maxi coat. Grey is a popular coat color for this look, but you can try navy or even a patterned coat. Sunglasses pull off the chic casual style of this look. Go with plain black glasses of any shape that you like. Try this look with either white sneakers or laced ankle boots.\n3. Wear a floor length coat with flared denim as an elegant-casual crossover. Floor-length coats take the classic long coat a few steps further; you can pull off a very cute, elegant casual look by pairing one with flared denim jeans. Wear this with an oversized knit sweater and dressy boots to complete the look. Add large sunglasses and a scarf to this look for extra flare.\n4. Try a long camel coat with a scarf for an intellectual touch. Long camel coats have an automatically sophisticated feel to them and are popular in the fall. Pair yours with black skinny jeans and a wide oversized scarf to look ready to hit the books. Complete this look with crisp white low-cut sneakers, a sweater, and pair of glasses.\n5. Add a beanie to any long coat for a fun casual look. Take the seriousness out of a long coat by adding a slouchy beanie on your head. Wear jeans or sweatpants, a long-sleeved T-shirt, and a pair of ankle boots or sneakers to finish off this casual style.\n6. Make an extra-long coat punk with colorful lace-up ankle boots. To achieve an 80s punk-inspired look, wear black skinny jeans and a button-down shirt with combat style boots under a mid-calf coat. To really finish off this look, add a few 1 inch (2.5 cm) band pins, or badges, to the lapels of your coat. Wear a pair of black sunglasses with this look to give it an extra rock-star vibe.\n7. Pair a pale maxi coat with cropped denim and a white T-shirt in the spring. Long coats aren’t just for fall and winter; you can pair lighter long jackets with a variety of spring looks as well. Try a pale blue, pink, or white long coat with light blue cropped jeans or shorts. Add a colorful fitted T-shirt and sandals to complete the look. Instead of denim, wear a short spring sundress and casual sandals under your light long coat for cute but informal effect.\n\n\n## Dress up with a long coat\n\n1. Wear a long coat over black cigarette pants and heels for a sophisticated look. A long coat that’s camel, grey, navy, red, or patterned looks great over top of black cigarette pants and heels. Wear a black blouse with this outfit, and try to match your heels with the coat for the best effect. For example, a camel coat with this outfit looks elegant with a pair of shiny nude heels.\n2. Try a long faux-fur coat with strappy heels for an elegant edge. No need to spend lots of money on real fur – there are many nice faux fur options out there for coats. Choose a black or white faux-fur coat and pair it with strappy heels, a short or mid-length skirt, or capris pants for an elegant look. Either chunky or stiletto heels work for this look; just make sure they are high and strappy.\n3. Pair leather leggings and heels with an extra-long black coat for serious glam. Find yourself a pair of black faux leather leggings and combine them with black heels of your choice for a glamourous look. Wear a simple white blouse underneath to finish off this look. Add a pair of classic large black sunglasses to this look for some extra glam.\n4. Wear a long unbuttoned coat over a cocktail dress for a night out. Go with a plain button-down black coat over a dark colored dress in the winter, or pair a lightweight camel trench coat over a light-colored or floral dress in the summer. Add heels to match your dress and jewelry to be ready for any formal occasion.\n5. Wear a Paletot or Guards’ coat for versatility. The Paletot and Guards’ coat styles are classic business coats for men that can be worn for any formal occasion. They are double-breasted with 2 rows of 6 buttons and peaked lapels. Navy blue or charcoal colors of this coat can be worn to a business meeting, over a tuxedo, or to a funeral.\n6. Pair a fitted long coat with dress trousers and loafers for any formal occasion. Dress trousers and shiny loafers, paired with a tucked button-down shirt, look sharp under any fitted long coat. Match your trousers to the coat and choose a dark colored shirt in the winter, or a lighter colored shirt in the summer. Add a tie that compliments your shirt to make this look extra formal.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "friendly. \n\nYou are the biggest problem in all of these examples of behavior. There's no getting around it, they're examples of a \"Sister in Law\" which is a type of problem. The best you're going to get is a patch for one part of the issue, but you have to accept that you'll be dealing with the underlying behavior the rest of the time.",
    "original_question": "How to handle a dramatic sister in law?",
    "response": "## Tone down the drama queen\n\n1. Realize that you may be dealing with a drama queen. The dynamics of a sister-in-law (S-I-L) are complex at the best of times but no more so if she has spent much of her life causing her immediate family to run to her beck and call. The drama queen thrives off drama and having everyone pay attention to her as a result. Sit back at your next family occasion and simply watch. Notice how she interacts with her family members, and how they in turn react back. If you witness a lot of step-toeing around her and acquiescing to her, she is clearly used to getting her own way. Consider what happens when she raises a drama-filled topic. Do other family members rush to agree with her about how \"outrageous\" the price of child care/electricity/shampoo/dog grooming/car maintenance/etc. is? Do they confirm her quibbles as quickly as possible, thereby engendering even more complaints? This shows that they enable her complaint-filled view of the world and sadly, have long been used to pandering to it. You can't change them but you can set a new role model by not complaining yourself. Notice what happens when you disagree with her. Does she pout, throw an adult-style tantrum or try and put you down? While it's important to stand your ground on things that matter to you, if she does react childishly, you'll need to learn how to manage this carefully. Learn not so much to disagree as to fail to agree––there is a fine line but it's about acknowledging her underlying need (notice me, care about me, help me, etc.) without buying into her view of the world.\n2. Do not get involved with the drama. Your S-I-L can let off steam, vent away and curse all she wants but there is no need to join the negativity. Avoid taking any of what is said personally––the crazier the reactions and actions, the more your S-I-L is grasping at straws to try and provoke you and restore the limelight back onto her. Let her have the limelight in her own home but don't hang around to be vented upon. If it gets really bad, simply announce that you will come back when she is feeling calmer and leave. Equally, if it's happening in your own home, tell it's time to leave. (You can even make up a fake appointment or an early bedtime if you really need a polite excuse.)\n\n\n## Deal with your hot button\n\n1. Look to yourself first. It can be hard when to do this when someone else pushes your buttons. But it is important because it is your reaction that defines whether or not she feels she can keep going in the same direction with you. Some of the things to consider include:\n\t* Stay silent and there's a risk she just thinks you're dumb, awed by her or chewed up with resentment. Take your pick, she's probably happy to think you're feeling all three. And she'll use your silence to keep putting across her point of view at the expense of yours. If you're grinning and bearing it, you're likely turning into a doormat. Argue and she probably thinks her brother/sister has married an angry, resentful and bitter so-and-so who hates her and will do anything to come between her and her brother/sister. You may feel as if you're defending yourself but to her, it's about you not caring what she thinks and possibly even about putting her down. This doesn't mean there isn't room for disagreement; it just means that the manner in which you realign her understanding must be done with care.\n2. Create boundaries. State the facts about matters that she pressures you about, firmly but politely, and avoid being emotional into the bargain. If you state things simply, stick to the facts and avoid making it into an issue about her, she has few places to run. Be aware that she may continue to resent you for speaking your mind in an assertive and self-effective way but this shouldn't stop you from clarifying your position. Ultimately, she has to respect someone who doesn't argue, lose their temper or bite their tongue but instead makes it absolutely clear where the boundaries exist. And even if she doesn't everyone else will plainly see that you are the cooler head in the room. For example, let's say your daughter Sheila has been running outside and has fallen over. Your S-I-L insists that she needs to see a doctor or something terrible might happen. You are quite sure nothing of the sort will occur and you know you're a good parent but S-I-L keeps badgering you, upping the intensity of all the bad things that will happen if you fail to follow her advice. Offer your S-I-L a calmly spoken \"That's very kind of you to notice that Sheila has a bruised knee but I am thoroughly satisfied that Sheila is going to be all right; this happens all the time and is a part of the way she learns to cope with the great outdoors. She does not need to see the doctor.\" And that's the end of it, no need to enter into any further discussion. If S-I-L keeps trying, smile and change the subject; refuse to re-engage on the matter.\n\n\n## You and your spouse\n\n1. Talk to your spouse about your feelings. Avoid name-calling, insulting or insinuating anything about your sister-in-law. Instead, explain how you feel when the proverbial dung hits the fan whenever you're in her presence. Your spouse cannot fault your feelings, so be clear and thoughtful in stating them. This puts your spouse on notice that you've recognized the behavior of your S-I-L for what it is and that you have chosen to no longer accept being at the receiving end of it. For example, \"Georgia, when your sister talks a lot about how hard it is to fund her children's private schooling, I feel claustrophobic because she doesn't know when to stop discussing it. Given that we can barely afford our mortgage, I feel a little distressed at this kind of talk all night. I'd like to stop putting myself in this position from now on by simply acknowledging her problem but not letting her continue discussing it all night and I'd like you to help me do this by finding other subjects to talk about that don't involve money. Do you think that this is something you can get on board with? \".\n2. Ask your spouse to think carefully about the way in which he or she relays information about family issues. Tell your spouse that you love to hear about how your sister-in-law is doing but that you don't appreciate hearing about the embellished drama that often comes with it. Help your spouse to recognize what you consider to be \"drama\" from what you consider to be \"real news\" and in time, both of you will learn to speak about family matters in a less dramatic and more emotionally healthy way. Remind your spouse gently whenever you feel that your S-I-L's drama is being repeated in your house. You could even have a special signal rather than having to spell it out each time. Place a ban on gossip at home (or anywhere). Remind one another whenever it veers anywhere near close to gossip and shut it down. It doesn't matter if you feel you are being gossiped about; you're the bigger person for not engaging in the same behavior.\n\n\n## Cop with your s-i-l's call and message\n\n1. Avoid answering what isn't worthy of a response. Don't respond to any text messages that do not directly relate to a family get-together, positive messages or something else perfectly normal. If you are getting texts that spell out her outrage about things that have happened to her, her annoyance at something you've apparently done or to send you gossip about family or friends, let it slide and leave her wondering. If you feel angry and want to send back a retort, reprimand or justification straight away, don't do it. Treat your anger or irritation as a warning sign to sleep on the matter. Furious texting or messaging can only end in more angst on both sides.\n2. Keep social media networking to a minimum with your sister-in-law if she sets off your buttons. If your S-I-L is truly a pain and a bit of a drama queen, it's possible that her social networking reflects her attention-seeking ways. You can be all too easily drawn into a web of her anger and drama venting if you can see her Facebook updates or her latest tweets. If she friends you, you can do one of several things. One, simply ignore the request. When she asks you about it, tell her that you don't use social media much to exchange important things (or at all); or\n\t* Two, reply to her with a \"Thanks but no thanks, I am not accepting new requests at the moment due to busyness/privacy/overloading, etc.\" You might also add something like, \"Besides, we see each other often and I prefer we talk face-to-face\"; or\n\t* Three, turn all of your settings to private so that she can't see who you are friends with. Either say nothing or tell her either that you stopped using social media or that you only have a tight knit circle of followers and don't wish to extend it at the moment. If you say you didn't receive any request, she'll only resend it, but it might buy enough time to throw her off the whole idea if you offer to \"look into it\" but let the \"looking into it\" drag on and refuse to raise the matter again); or\n\t* Four, offer her a more neutral alternative. Offer to friend her on Pinterest and focus solely on a shared craft or cooking board. Nothing racy or mean spirited, of course. Try to avoid using the terminology of \"friends\" when discussing any refusal to accept her request. Unfortunately, the usage of this term by social media sites has caused many people to take it at face value; many people are simply followers or fans, not friends. She might feel devalued if you make any suggestion that she is being rejected as a \"friend\". If she is already a follower of one or more of your networking sites, you might consider blocking her and turning your pages private on some sites. Most probably you will need to explain what has happened (with a sound excuse); if she's a drama queen, she'll not only notice but she'll take offense too.\n3. Take care if you do soldier on and try to be her friend online and/or through the phone. If she acts abusively, it is recommended that you keep records to show your spouse and other family members if needed. Save messages, emails, voice-mails, etc. Some drama queens like to \"attack\" when nobody else can see, thinking you won't have the courage to out them. This isn't about deliberately looking for dirt but it is a way of protecting yourself if anything should get out of hand. However, this is truly the stuff of last resort––if you handle yourself deftly in public situations around your S-I-L, everyone will know for real who is behaving and who is stirring the pot.\n\n\n## A kinder future together\n\n1. Get on with your lives together. You married your spouse, not your family. While his or her family members are part of the package, they are not a part of your intimacy and they do not share the same journey with the two of you. If you make it very obvious that you're not bothered by jealousy, insinuations, rumors or gossip, it will soon become clear to your S-I-L that her barbs, attitude and meanness aren't pricking you in the way that they used to. Eventually, it ceases to be profitable or enjoyable for her to keep bothering and most likely she'll begrudgingly go and find someone else to taunt and hassle. Spend less time around your S-I-L. In what ways are you putting yourself in her pathway? While it may feel like you have to put up with her, you can find ways to reduce the time spent together. For example, ask other family members to meet you at different times than when she is around, more often than not. Don't always do this, or she will have a legitimate cause for complaining, but time spent with other family members shouldn't always involve her presence. If you live far away and have to visit once a year, stay in your own accommodation to give yourself respite. Take walks, get outside and don't overstay any welcome when it comes to drawn-out family events that press your buttons. Families know the pressure points better than anyone and unfortunately, some like to press them. At such events, your S-I-L probably has alliances that she can set in train to be even more effective, so the less time spent near such complaint-prone cliques, the better.\n2. Listen for real. When you are around your S-I-L, try active listening and acknowledgment in place of letting your fog of self-defensiveness take control. When she gets on top of her complaining mountain, instead of trying to topple her off with \"if you think that's bad, you should live in my shoes\" replies, actually focus on her and try to discern what is really driving her jibes, whining and gossip. By not making this about you, you may be truly surprised at what you unearth.As for responding to her, acknowledge her pain with neutral comments like: \"I'm sorry you have had to go through that to pay an electricity bill. It must be hard having four kids chewing through the power each month.\" Don't offer advice, don't offer how you would deal with it and don't ever offer to pay or pave the way to see her problem resolved. She owns it, you simply acknowledge it.\n3. Be compassionate. If your S-I-L has been a pain more than once and has even done things to show you up or drag you down, the chances are that she will try to do it again, even when you don't bite. But if you're ready for it and if you're understanding as to where she is coming from (insecurity, loneliness, feeling left out, needing to be in control, etc. ), you can be compassionate about her actions and detach yourself from her drama. If you don't carry her load, she'll be forced to do it for herself and will stop seeing you as a viable target.\n",

    "response": "The syntax you tried is actually ambiguous. Depending on how many days are in the month, some months it will run on odd days and some on even. This is because the way it is calculated takes the total number of possibilities and divides them up. You can override this strage-ish behavior by manually specifying the day range and using either an odd or even number of days. Since even day scripts would never run on the 31st day of longer months, you don't lose anything using 30 days as the base for even-days, and by specifying specifically to divide it up as if there were 31 days you can force odd-day execution.\n\nThe syntax would look like this:\n```# Will only run on odd days:\n0 0 1-31/2 * * command\n# Will only run on even days:\n0 0 2-30/2 * * command\n```\n\nYour concern about months not having the same number of days is not important here because no months have MORE days than this, and for poor February, the date range just won't ever match the last day or two, but it will do no harm having it listed.\n\nThe only 'gotcha' for this approach is that if you are on an odd day cycle, following months with 31 days your command will also run on the first of the month. Likewise if you are forcing an even cycle, each leap year will cause one three-day cycle at the end of February. You cannot really get around the fact that any regular pattern of \"every other day\" is not always going to fall on even or odd days in every month and any way you force this you will either have an extra run or be missing a run between months with mismatched day counts.",

    "original_question": "How to physically flirt with a girl?",
    "response": "Flirting builds attraction and tension, but it has to be done in the right way. Done in the wrong way, the girl you like might scurry off and never look back. Like all flirting, body language attraction is a fun process, but don’t rush it. Slowly position yourself so that you can flirt with your crush with confidence, and most importantly, have fun with it.\n\n## Get her to warm up to you\n\n1. Get to know her. Think about what she likes and her interests. Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you’re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.\n2. Compliment her. Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you’re trying to \"game\" her. Girls like compliments as long as it doesn’t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you. Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes. Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you’re not. Don’t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. “You’re pretty for a brunette” is not a compliment. Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.\n3. Make eye contact when you speak to her. It not only lets her know that you’re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn’t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she’ll be more likely to open up to you.\n4. Mimic her body language. If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal. Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet.\n5. Give her attention in a crowd. Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do.\n6. Call her just to talk. Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better. Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you’re thinking about her. You don’t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn’t really exist. Just be “normal.\"\n7. Bring her something. Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her. Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn’t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it.\n8. Text her to ask you to meet you somewhere. If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don’t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group\n\n\n## Sneak to touch her\n\n1. Touch her knee against yours. Slowly move your knee toward hers until they touch lightly. Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs. Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals. If it doesn’t look like she’s enjoying it, stop.\n2. Touch her hand or arm when you laugh. Say something funny, or laugh at her jokes and then laugh. While you’re laughing, gently touch the top of her hand or forearm as if to say “ you jokester.” This should look casual and natural. It should look as is if you do this to everyone when you laugh. If you are sitting down when this happens, take this opportunity to casually slide your chair closer to hers.\n3. Tuck her hair behind her ear. This works best if she has a strand of hair out of place or a strand hanging in her face. Gently, tuck the hair behind her ear so that it is out of her face.\n4. Put your hand close to hers. When you are sitting next to her at a table, always place your hand so that it is really close to hers. A finger length apart or a little more is a good distance. To take it a step further, place your hands on hers for just a second as if it is accidental.\n5. Play footsie. If you're sitting at a table/desk across from her, gently put your feet on top of hers. It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl’s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you’re interested. If she looks under the table and smiles, then she is happy that the person gently kicking her is you.\n\n\n## Flirt with her overtly\n\n1. Hug her. It’s a reason to touch her in a non-sexual way. It’s also a legitimate reason to touch her without seeming too flirty especially if you greet her with a hug. If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her.You could possibly get a hug every time you see her. If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs. However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately.\n2. Play with her hair. Some girls like this. Focus on the hair at the nape of the neck because playing with her hair in this area will probably give her chills -- in a good way. If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.) From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.) If all is well, start to rub her neck like you’re giving her a neck massage.\n3. Put your hands around her waist from behind. If she likes you, she'll most likely lean back on you. Touch her gently so you don't startle her. If you two get really comfortable she might even let you slide your hand down a little lower. Once she’s comfortable with you putting your hands on her waist, grab her and swing her around. Then, she’ll be facing you. Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You’ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face. (Beware: Some girls are extremely ticklish and tend to involuntarily squeal or giggle when someone touches their waists).\n4. Push her playfully. When you're walking next to her on a sidewalk or path, gently push her off the path. She'll probably push you back, which will start some playful flirting. Because even childishly pushing each other is a way of flirting. (Don't do this on a busy road though. Someone might get hurt.)\n5. Put your head in her lap. If you're already friends and you're watching a movie, reading, or just talking with friends, go over and lie your head in her lap. Let her play with your hair. If she pushes you off, just laugh. This only works well if you’ve flirted with this girl many times before.\n6. Tickle her. Good areas for tickling are under her ribs or the sides or her stomach. If she likes you, she'll tickle you back -- probably while smiling or laughing. Watch her signals though, if she doesn't like it or if she pulls away, stop. You don’t want to annoy her and ruin any chances of getting close to her again. If she pulls away, revert back to the physical touching that she seems to be comfortable with and do that for a while.\n7. Be respectful. Pay attention to her body language and anything that she says. You don't want to overstep her boundaries. Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, \"stop\" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop. She'll perceive you as invading her space and possibly harassing her. Neither are attractive or respectful.\n",

    "original_question": "I'd never heard of anycast until a few seconds ago when I read \"What are some cool or useful server/networking tricks?\".\nThe wikipedia \"Anycast\" article on it is quite formal and doesn't really evoke a mental picture of how it would be used.\nCan someone explain in a few informal sentences what \"anycast\" is, how you configure it (just in a general sense), and what its benefits are (what does it make easier)?",
    "response": "Anycast is networking technique where the same IP prefix is advertised from multiple locations. The network then decides which location to route a user request to, based on routing protocol costs and possibly the 'health' of the advertising servers.\n\nThere are several benefits to anycast. First, in steady state, users of an anycast service (DNS is an excellent example) will always connect to the 'closest' (from a routing protocol perspective) DNS server. This reduces latency, as well as providing a level of load-balancing (assuming that your consumers are evenly distributed around your network).\nAnother advantage is ease of configuration management. Rather than having to configure different DNS servers depending on where a server/workstation is deployed (Asia, America, Europe), you have one IP address that is configured in every location.\n\nDepending on how anycast is implemented, it can also provide a level of high availability. If the advertisement of the anycast route is conditional on some sort of health check (e.g. a DNS query for a well known domain, in this example), then as soon as a server fails its route can be removed. Once the network reconverges, user requests will be seamlessly forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS, without the need for any manual intervention or reconfiguration.\n\nA final advantage is that of horizontal scaling; if you find that one server is being overly loaded, simply deploy another one in a location that would allow it to take some proportion of the overloaded server's requests. Again, as no client configuration is required, this can be done very quickly.",

    "original_question": "What are the primary objections Democrats have to a border wall?",
    "response": "It's not clear to me that Democrats are opposed to border-wall construction (your one source suggests they are fine with border walls/fences where necessary), so much as they opposed to some of the plans for full-border walls that have been put forth so far.\nRecently, in response to reports that the spending bill would include funding for a border wall, 5 Democratic senators released a letter voicing concerns over the cost, the effectiveness, and the legal issues of constructing it.\n\nWe are also concerned with reports that there may be an effort to include funding for a very expensive new wall along the southern border with Mexico and a “deportation force.”  According to non-partisan experts, the proposed new border wall could cost as much as $25 million per mile and raises considerable issues that have not been resolved by the Congress or the Department of Homeland Security.  First, many experts believe that such a border wall will not work.  Second, there is real concern that the Administration, put simply, has no plan to build the border wall.  For example, the Administration has not detailed how to 1) use eminent domain and other procedures to acquire land from private landowners and Native American tribes, 2) design the wall, 3) locate the wall, 4) construct the wall, and 5) require Mexico to pay for the wall given the President’s clear and repeated promises that he would force Mexico to do so. Finally, there are objections to the construction of a wall from Democratic and Republican members of Congress that represent border states.  Given these and other concerns, we believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump’s Administration.\n[...]\nSenator Charles Schumer\nSenator Richard Durbin\nSenator Patty Murray\nSenator Debbie Stabenow\nSenator Patrick Leahy\n\nBased on this letter, it appears their main objections to a full border wall are currently the cost-benefit ratio and the legal issues of taking land from Americans to build it on; objections that may not be unique to Democrats.",

    "generated_instruction": "I need help on how to make my elderly dog comfortable at the end of life. What steps should I follow when he's dying at home, and how should I make the experience with my dog at the vet office if it comes to that?",
    "original_question": "How to comfort a dying dog?",
    "response": "Although it is a natural part of life, it is never easy saying goodbye to your beloved canine companion. During this stage of life, you will want to make your dog as comfortable as possible. The comfort you provide throughout this potentially frightening situation will make the transition easier for your dog and bring you peace of mind as well.\n\n## Comfort your dog at home\n\n1. Stay patient with your dog. Older dogs commonly begin experiencing joint and muscle problems, and they can become frustrated with their discomfort and impairments. If your dog is grumpy or irritable during the end stages of life, simply do your best to be patient and provide the other comforts you can at home.\n2. Provide a quiet environment. Chaos around the home will only stress both you and your dog as you're trying to spend the final hours of your dog's life together meaningfully and with compassion. Give your dog a quiet environment away from noisy children or other animals in the house. Soft, unobtrusive music can also be calming, or you may also use a nature soundtrack with birdsong and the sounds of running water.\n3. Speak in comforting tones. Reassure your dog that he's not alone and speak in soft comforting tones. Tell him “good boy” and the other phrases you normally use for positive reinforcement to let him know it's okay. Give him plenty of light pets as well. If you want to make sure you're there for the final moments, then you may choose to sleep next to his bed in a sleeping bag for the final nights.\n4. Put down comfortable bedding. If your dog has a favorite dog bed, put it down for him. Otherwise you can put down some other blankets to help him lay down comfortably. Your dog may also have difficulty regulating his body temperature at the end, so keep some blankets handy to put over him in the event that he shows signs of being cold. Elderly dogs are also prone to pressure sores, so put down extra cushioning for an older dog. On a practical note, he may also have problems with incontinence at the end. Choose a spot you can easily clean and bedding you can wash later. If your dog does have any accidents, then clean them up patiently without scolding him. He can't help it. If your dog gets cold, you can also use a heater in the area to make him more comfortable.\n5. Keep fresh water available. Hydration is still important to keeping your dog comfortable even in the final hours. Provide a bowl of water next to the dog bed, so your dog doesn't have to get up to drink. If your is having trouble rising even to drink, then use a clean dropper to help provide water.\n6. Prepare some of his favorite meal. If your dog has always had a favorite thing to eat, then you should make some of it in case he's hungry. However, it is pretty common for dogs to lose their appetite in the end stages of life, so don't force him to eat if he's not hungry. Solid food may also upset your dog's stomach at the end as certain systems related to digestion begin shutting down. If your dog still shows a willingness to eat but regular food is upsetting his stomach, then try mixing some baby food with water, or you can also try the Hills A/D diet, which is liquid.\n7. See your veterinarian about pain management. If your dog still has enough time and you're worried about pain in the final stages, then you can consult your vet for pain management options for the final days. Signs that your dog might be in pain include excessive panting or gasping for breath or reluctance to move.\n8. Hug your dog one final time. Once your dog passes, give him one final hug and say goodbye. It's a very painful moment, so remember that it's perfectly okay to cry, but also remember the good times you had with your pet and that he passed in a comfortable, loving environment with you doing everything you could. Be aware that some dogs seem to \"move\" or \"take a breath\" after passing away. As their nervous system shuts down, sometimes muscles in the body or lungs can spasm and look like a sign of life. It's also common for dogs to pass with their eyes open. You can close them if you want as you say your final goodbye, or you can pull one of the blankets over his head.\n9. Take care of yourself. Once your pet has passed, know that you did everything you could and worry about taking care of yourself. Seek comfort in other loved ones who understand the loss. You can also light candles or say a small prayer for your pet if it feels right and helps. The ASPCA also has a hotline you can call to talk to someone who understands the difficulty of losing a pet. You can reach this hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n10. Handle your pet's remains. Though it's unpleasant, you do have to do something with your pet's remains once he passes. Many people choose to cremate pets or bury them whether in a pet cemetery or closer to home. Many services are available to help you deal with the remains to make the process easier on you. Look online or ask your vet for services in your area that will help with the option of your choosing.\n\n\n## Comfort your dog at the vet\n\n1. Consult a professional about euthanasia. The ASPCA has a specific hotline for those dealing with the difficult decision of euthanizing a pet. The line gives you someone to talk to who will understand your grief throughout the process, as well as information about your dog's quality of life at this stage and whether or not euthanasia may be the most humane option. You can reach the ASPCA hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n2. Make the appointment. Though it hurts to do and it always feels too soon, you'll have to make an appointment for the vet to euthanize him when you know your dog is at the end of life. Your vet is likely to suggest this option if your dog's condition has significantly deteriorated and the vet believes the dog is in pain.\n3. Bring some of your dog's favorite items. You'll want to surround your dog with a few of his favorite things at the end. A favorite blanket and a soft toy are very common items that you may choose to bring with to help comfort him as he passes. Favorite blankets or a dog bed will also be much more comfortable for your dog than the exam table, especially if he's already in discomfort.\n4. Sign any forms at the vet. When you sign in for the appointment, you'll also have a few forms to fill out, including a consent form signaling that you know what is about to happen. While filling out forms is the last thing you want to focus on, it is a necessary part of the process.\n5. Ask about a sedative beforehand. If your dog is experiencing any pain or discomfort from a medical condition, ask the veterinarian about giving him a sedative. This will make your dog more comfortable, and it will give you the peace of mind later knowing that your dog passed without any pain.\n6. Pet your dog with gentle, loving strokes. Once you've been taken back to the private room and placed your dog down on his blankets with any other items, focus all your energy on spending quality final moments with him. The veterinarian will have to finish setting up the necessary items, so use this time to offer soft praise to your dog. Tell him you love him and pet him in his favorite spots.\n7. Hug your dog. Your vet will ensure you're ready and then begin injecting the solution to euthanize your dog. Many people choose to hug their dog during these moments because the process is fairly quick. Between six and twelve seconds after the solution is delivered, your dog will take a deep breath and then appear to fall into a deep sleep before taking a few more final breaths. Some pet owners also prefer not to be in the room for the actual injection and passing. The veterinarian's office is used to people who need to cope and grieve in their own ways. Ultimately decide what is right for you.\n8. Give yourself time. Do not be embarrassed to cry in front of the vet or other employees at the clinic. They all understand what you're going through. After your dog has passed away, your veterinarian will give you the option to spend some additional one-on-one time with your dog. Some owners take this opportunity to say a few last words to their dog while others choose to pass on this option.\n9. Discuss options for the remains. After giving you the time you need, your vet will discuss options concerning what to do with your dog's remains. This may include releasing them to you for burial or cremating them, which the vet can take care of. You can choose cremation either with the intent to take the cremains with you or not. In some places, it is against the law for the vet to return your pet's body to you for burial.\n",

    "response": "The decision to use 1st January 1753 (```1753-01-01```) as the minimum date value for a datetime in SQL Server goes back to its Sybase origins.\nThe significance of the date itself though can be attributed to this man.\n\nPhilip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield. Who steered the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 through the British Parliament. This legislated for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar for Britain and its then colonies. \n\nThere were some missing days (internet archive link) in the British calendar in 1752 when the adjustment was finally made from the Julian calendar. September 3, 1752 to September 13, 1752 were lost.\nKalen Delaney explained the choice this way\n\n> So, with 12 days lost, how can you compute dates? For example, how can you compute the number of days between October 12, 1492, and July 4, 1776? Do you include those missing 12 days? To avoid having to solve this problem, the original Sybase SQL Server developers decided not to allow dates before 1753. You can store earlier dates by using character fields, but you can't use any datetime functions with the earlier dates that you store in character fields.\n\nThe choice of 1753 does seem somewhat anglocentric however as many catholic countries in Europe had been using the calendar for 170 years before the British implementation (originally delayed due to opposition by the church). Conversely many countries did not reform their calendars until much later, 1918 in Russia. Indeed the October Revolution of 1917 started on 7 November under the Gregorian calendar.\nBoth ```datetime``` and the new ```datetime2``` datatype mentioned in Joe's answer do not attempt to account for these local differences and simply use the Gregorian Calendar.\nSo with the greater range of ```datetime2```\n```SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, DATEADD(DAY,-5,CAST('1752-09-13' AS DATETIME2)),100)\n```\nReturns\n```Sep  8 1752 12:00AM\n```\nOne final point with the ```datetime2``` data type is that it uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar projected backwards to well before it was actually invented so is of limited use in dealing with historic dates.\nThis contrasts with other Software implementations such as the Java Gregorian Calendar class which defaults to following the Julian Calendar for dates until October 4, 1582 then jumping to October 15, 1582 in the new Gregorian calendar. It correctly handles the Julian model of leap year before that date and the Gregorian model after that date. The cutover date may be changed by the caller by calling ```setGregorianChange()```. \nA fairly entertaining article discussing some more peculiarities with the adoption of the calendar can be found here.",

    "original_question": "In Civilization V, you attain a cultural victory by accumulating enough culture to purchase at least 36 social policies, and then building a wonder. The catch is that the more cities you build, the more culture you need to generate before you hit the next \"plateau\" of culture.\nWhat is the ideal number of cities for a cultural victory? Does it change over time? ",
    "response": "The question you're really asking is &quot;When does the combined culture / turn of an additional city outstrip the increase in social policy cost incurred by founding that city?&quot;\nThe short answer is...\nWe know that adding another city increases the culture costs by approximately 30% of the base cost (that of 1 city). Therefore:\nIf your maximum potential culture / turn won't increase by at least 30% due to the new city, you are hurting, not helping, the time till your next social policy.\n(This may be slightly hard to calculate, and if you take too long to reach your &quot;maximum potential culture / turn&quot; you're actually wasting turns.)\nThe long answer is...\nIt depends\nTo begin with, we need to make some assumptions:\n\n* When you found a new city, you can get its culture / turn maximized within a single turn by buying the necessary building improvements (monument, etc).\n\n* Ignore city-states, leader specific abilities, +culture social policies, and wonders. These all help produce culture, and will shift the &quot;ideal city count&quot; down, but do so inconsistently. To produce an &quot;ideal&quot; city count, we limit ourselves by era and improvements alone.\n\n* This list of social policy costs is accurate for the given parameters: medium map and normal speed.\n\nAnd now, some math.\nThe 1st social policy costs 25 points with a single city. In the ancient era, your cities can generate 2 culture / turn due to the monument. (Remember, we're ignoring the palace for now)\nThis means that it will take 13 turns (Ceiling(25/2) to enact the policy, or 9 turns (ceiling (45/4) with two cities. We can continue this extrapolation -- 8 turns with 3 cities, 7 turns with 4 cities, 6 turns with 5 cities, and we finally reach diminishing returns at city 6 (also 6 turns).\nFor the second social policy, the ramifications of the # of cities gets magnified due to a larger starting value: One city takes 23 turns, two cities take 15 turns, three cities take 13 turns, four cities take 12, five cities take 10, and again, we run into diminishing returns cap out at at six cities (10 turns).\nIt is not until the 4th social policy that this trend is broken and diminishing returns end at the NINTH! city.\nRemember -- this assumes that each city has a monument the minute it is founded.\nNow let's say we've reached the classical age, and have temples in addition to monuments. Each city is now generating 5 culture.\nThe first policy takes 5 turns with a single city, 4 turns with two, and 3 with three.\nWhat (hopefully) becomes clear is that we reached diminishing returns (4 cities as opposed to 6 cities) much faster when each individual city's contribution is higher. The more culture any one city is capable of producing, the more incentive there is to produce more cities. Even if you don't manage to build every +culture improvement immediately, you're still likely to come out ahead (as long as you're pre-diminishing returns).\nSo while the optimal number of cities changes due to any number of factors, you can probably safely not shoot yourself in the foot if you stay between three and six cities, with six being on the high end.",

    "original_question": "How to hold your breath for long periods of time?",
    "response": "The ability to hold your breath for a long period of time is a much sought-after skill. Maybe you want to last longer underwater while diving or surfing, or maybe you're just looking for an impressive party trick. Whatever the reason, it is actually surprisingly easy to increase the amount of time you can go without breathing, provided you use the right training techniques and follow adequate safety precautions. Read below to find out how.\n\n## Optimize your lung capacity\n\n1. Do exercises to increase your lung capacity. While there is no way to increase your lung size, there are many ways to increase the amount of air your lungs take in, and the efficiency with which they capture oxygen. In particular, a rigorous exercise routine can help to strengthen your lungs and maximize their capacity to hold air. Do plenty of cardio. Incorporating some intense cardio workouts into your weekly routine can do wonders for your lungs. Running, skipping, aerobics and swimming are all great forms of cardiovascular exercise which get the blood pumping and the lungs working hard to supply the body with the oxygen it needs to keep going. Try doing exercising in intense 30 minute bursts, pushing your body to its limits, to achieve the best result. Exercise in water. Exercising in water (swimming, water aerobics, underwater weight training) is also a form of cardio exercise, but the water provides an element of resistance which requires the body to work harder to complete each task. As a result, the lungs need to work harder to supply the body with oxygen, causing their air capacity to increase significantly over time. Work-out at high elevation. At higher elevations, there is less oxygen in the air, meaning your lungs have to work harder to supply the body with oxygen. This is an excellent way to strengthen the lungs, but you must be careful not to train to hard, or you could potentially fall victim to altitude sickness.\n2. Lose weight. Any excess baggage reduces your body's efficiency in using oxygen, as there is increased body mass to which your blood must pump oxygen. As a result, many competitive breath holders will attempt to shed any extra pounds in the weeks coming up to a competition. This weight loss should be achieved in a strictly healthy way - through exercise and balanced diet - as weakening your body through crash dieting will negatively impact your ability to hold your breath. The world record breath holder, Aleix Segura Vendrell, is reported to have lost weight for 4 months before attempting to beat the world record for holding breath underwater, in an effort to improve his ratio of body volume to lung volume.\n3. Quit smoking. The fact that smoking has a negative impact on lung strength and capacity is common knowledge. Quitting can considerably increase your lungs' ability to release carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen, even within a matter of weeks. So if you are trying to strengthen your lungs and increase their capacity, giving up smoking is undoubtedly the first thing on the to-do list. You should also try to avoid second-hand smoke as far as possible, as inhaling someone else's cigarette smoke can have a negative effect on your lungs.\n4. Take up a wind or brass instrument. These types of instruments require plenty of lung power, making them a great way to improve lung strength and increase your ability to control your breathing. And aside from that, playing an instrument is a fantastic life skill, which can provide immense personal satisfaction. The flute, clarinet, oboe and saxophone are all good options when it comes to wind instruments, while the trumpet, trombone and tuba are popular brass options. If you have a good voice, singing is another great musical aid to improving lung power. Singing requires immense control of one's breathing, making it an excellent complimentary activity for aspiring breath-holders.\n\n\n## Train techniques for hold your breath\n\n1. Practice deep breathing. Before holding your breath, inhale and exhale slowly from deep within your diaphragm. By doing this, you're ridding your lungs of low-quality air. Spend five seconds breathing in, then hold the breath for one second, before breathing out for ten seconds. Continue deep breathing for two minutes, and be sure that when you exhale, you push out every last \"drop\" of air. As you exhale, push your tongue up against your teeth.This forms a valve which helps to control the release of air. Your breath should make a hissing sound as it is released. Deep breathing allows your body to take in excess oxygen, which it can then store in the blood cells. This helps when holding your breath as your body can use the stored oxygen to continue functioning, even when you are not breathing.\n2. Purge the CO2 from your lungs. When holding your breath, the pressure you feel in your lungs is not the result of a need to breathe, but rather the result of a build-up of CO2, fighting to be released. This build-up of CO2 becomes increasingly painful as time goes on. To minimize this build-up, it is necessary to purge any pre-existing CO2 from your lungs, before holding your breath. To do this:\n\t* Exhale forcefully, pushing as much air out of your lungs as possible. Puff out your cheeks as you do this, and imagine you are trying to blow a toy sailboat across a stretch of water. Once you have exhaled completely, inhale quickly and repeat. Try to keep your body as still as possible while you do this, to avoid expending any of the stored oxygen from the previous step.\n3. Take a breath and hold it for one minute and thirty seconds. This is a practice run which will allow your body to adjust to the sensation of going without air. Use a timer to count down the 90 seconds, and don't attempt to hold your breath for any longer just yet. When you inhale, don't breathe in so much that you're about to pop; this creates tension in your body and causes you to expend more energy. Instead, fill your lung capacity to about 80-85% capacity so that you still have room to relax. Once the 90 seconds is up, exhale briefly to rid your lungs of the used air, then take three breaths, inhaling and exhaling fully. This is known as semi-purging.\n4. Repeat the process of deep breathing and purging, then hold your breath for two minutes and thirty seconds. Once the first 90 second practice run is up, repeat the deep breathing and purging exercises. Perform each exercise for a duration of one minute and thirty seconds. Once this is done, take a breath and hold it for two minutes and thirty seconds, timing it on a stopwatch. Do not attempt to hold your breath for any longer than this. Once the time is up, exhale to release the used air and take three semi-purge breaths. Follow this with two minutes of deep breathing and a minute and a half of purging. You are now ready to try holding your breath for as long as possible.\n5. Splash cold water on your face. At this point, you may decide to splash your face with some cold water before attempting to hold your breath. It has been observed that putting a person's face in contact with cold water triggers bradycardia, or the slowing of the heart rate, which is the first phase of the mammalian diving reflex. However, this step is purely optional. You don't need to actually put your entire head underwater, though. Just splash some cold water on your face right before you hold your breath, or try using a cold, wet washcloth. Don't use an ice pack instead of water, though; the same study suggests that the shock of something too cold triggers other reflexes. Just make sure the water is at a temperature of approximately 70 °F (21 °C) and that the rest of your body is in a relaxed position.\n6. Take a breath and hold it for as long as possible. Assume a comfortable seated position and take a deep breath, filling your lungs to about 80-85% of capacity. Hold your breath for as long as possible, staying completely still to avoid expending unnecessary energy and wasting oxygen. It is usually better to have someone else timing your progress, as time will pass more quickly and you will be able to hold your breath for longer if you are not constantly watching the clock. Holding your breath for long periods of time can be painful, and it usually necessary to find a way to distract yourself if you are to successfully achieve your goal. One popular distraction technique is to move through the alphabet from A to Z, thinking of a friend, celebrity or historical figure whose name begins with each letter. Aleix Segura Vendrell, who set a world record for holding his breath underwater for 24 minutes and 3 seconds, is a proponent of this very technique. Don't hold air in your cheeks. This method is meant for an air reserve, which requires \"letting go\" of the air in your lungs and switching it with the air in your cheeks. This is known as \"circular breathing\" and can be very difficult to achieve, usually resulting in the breath-holder losing both air reserves. Therefore, it may be best to avoid this method for the time being.\n7. Relax every muscle in your body. It is vital that you relax completely and release any tension from your body as you hold your breath. Close your eyes and focus on releasing the tension from each body part in turn, starting with your feet, and moving slowly upwards along your body, all the way up to your neck and head. By doing this, it is possible to significantly lower your heart rate and increase the time you are able to hold your breath for. Concentrate on something that's relaxing to you. When you can't concentrate anymore, distract yourself by doing something with your hands, like counting to 99 with your fingers. Try not to move during any point when holding your breath. When you move, you waste oxygen and that will cut down the time you're able to go without breathing. Stay still.\n8. Exhale slowly. When you can't hold your breath anymore, try to avoid exhaling all the air in your lungs in a mad rush. First, exhale about 20% of your air, then inhale again so that oxygen gets to your most critical areas faster. Then you can exhale and inhale completely.\n9. Repeat these steps 3-4 times per session. It is not recommended to do this any more, as it could damage your lungs and body. Try one session in the morning and one session at night if you wish. Keep practicing and before you know it, you will be able to hold your breath for several minutes.\n\n\n## Take the necessary safety precautions\n\n1. Always practice with a partner. It is highly advisable that you practice holding your breath with a partner. The main reason for this is that they can ensure your safety if you happen to pass out (which is fairly common during limit-testing training sessions), preventing you from hurting yourself and taking care of you while you recover your senses. In addition, a partner can help to time your breath-holding sessions, notifying you at each 30 second interval.\n2. Practice sitting up, rather than lying down. The best position to practice holding your breath in is sitting upright in a comfortable position, such as on a sofa or armchair. This allows you to expend as little energy as possible while holding your breath. It is not advised that you lie down while holding your breath, as you run the risk of choking on your tongue if you happen to pass out.\n3. Do not attempt to do this underwater, unless supervised by a professional. Although the purpose of learning to hold your breath for longer is usually for use underwater, you should never do underwater training alone, without supervision. As mentioned before, it is quite common for people to black out or lose consciousness after holding their breath for prolonged periods, and if this happens underwater it can lead to drowning. Even practicing with a partner can be dangerous, as an untrained eye may be unable to tell the difference between someone who is holding their breath and someone who has passed out. If you do decide to practice with a partner, make sure that you decide on a hand signal which you can give at regular intervals to indicate to your partner that you are okay.\n",

Moreover, C♯ is one semitone above C and D♭ is one semitone below D. Therefore, C♯ and D♭ should be equivalent. If so, how can C♯ and D♭ actually differ by 41 cents from each other?",
    "response": "When we talk about the exact frequencies of each pitch class, we have to know the temperament, and a reference pitch. For example, 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) with A4=440Hz is a standard in modern music. From those two parameters, we can extrapolate the exact frequency of every possible note.\n\n12TET is nearly ubiquitous nowadays (at least in Western music), but it doesn't sound as clean as Just Intonation (JI). In essence, 12TET has made every key sound equally imperfect. JI creates a scale where the intervals in the primary chords are all very nice simple ratios, and so the chords ring out very cleanly, but it only works in that key. Important note: within a given JI tuning, each of the 12 pitch classes still has only one single frequency. There is no difference between C♯ and D♭ in, say, \"Pythagorean tuning based on A, with A=440Hz\".\n\nBut most music doesn't stay in one key. While a piano can't make pitch adjustments on the fly (which is why we've agreed to use 12TET for it), most instruments in an orchestra can. So when the piece is in A major, the orchestra will use JI and adjust C♯ to be a little flatter than it would be if using 12TET. But then if the piece modulates to F♯ minor, they'll start playing it slightly sharp.\n\nWhen people say that C♯ is not the same as D♭, what they really mean (whether they realize it or not) is that context may make for different micro-adjustments. In C major, a C♯ might be the third of an A major chord, perhaps a secondary dominant of the ii chord, while D♭ might be the root of the Neapolitan chord. These would result in different tuning choices.",

    "original_question": "If user input is inserted without modification into an SQL query, then the application becomes vulnerable to SQL injection, like in the following example:\n```$unsafe_variable = $_POST['user_input'];\nmysql_query(\"INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES ('$unsafe_variable')\");\n```\nThat's because the user can input something like ```value'); DROP TABLE table;--```, and the query becomes:\n```INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES('value'); DROP TABLE table;--')\n```\nWhat can be done to prevent this from happening?",
    "response": "The correct way to avoid SQL injection attacks, no matter which database you use, is to separate the data from SQL, so that data stays data and will never be interpreted as commands by the SQL parser. It is possible to create an SQL statement with correctly formatted data parts, but if you don't fully understand the details, you should always use prepared statements and parameterized queries. These are SQL statements that are sent to and parsed by the database server separately from any parameters. This way it is impossible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL.\n\nYou basically have two options to achieve this:\n\n1. Using PDO (for any supported database driver):\n```\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');\n$stmt->execute([ 'name' => $name ]);\n\nforeach ($stmt as $row) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\n2. Using MySQLi (for MySQL):\nSince PHP 8.2+ we can make use of execute_query() which prepares, binds parameters, and executes SQL statement in one method:\n```\n$result = $dbConnection->execute_query('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?', [$name]);\n\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\nUp to PHP8.1:\n```\n$stmt = $dbConnection->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');\n$stmt->bind_param('s', $name); // 's' specifies the variable type => 'string'\n$stmt->execute();\n\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\nIf you're connecting to a database other than MySQL, there is a driver-specific second option that you can refer to (for example, pg_prepare() and pg_execute() for PostgreSQL).

    "generated_instruction": "What is the best way to cope with the idea of having a child with a chromosomal disability, given that many of the children have such a unique disorder that there is hardly any information on the internet?",
    "original_question": "How to deal with diagnosis of a rare chromosome disorder in a child?",
    "response": "Most people have heard of Down syndrome. But there are hundreds of other chromosome disorders a child can have, many of which are diagnosed in only a few children, or may even be unique to that child.\n\n## Get information\n\n1. Learn about genetics. Most people have 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. One pair is the sex chromosomes, which in males is usually XY and in females XX. The other 22 pairs, known as autosomes, are numbered by size, with chromosome 1 being the biggest. Each chromosome has a longer arm, called the q arm, and a shorter arm, called the p arm. Each arm has bands that are numbered, with the band closest to the middle (centromere) being numbered 11.1. Terminus (shortened to \"ter\") refers to a tip of a chromosome. A \"terminal\" chromosome disorder is not fatal; it just involves the terminus. Learn about the types of changes. Nullisomy means that there are zero copies of a chromosome. Deletion/monosomy means that there is only one copy of the chromosome or piece of chromosome. Duplication/trisomy means that there are 3 copies. Tetrasomy and pentasomy refer to 4 and 5 copies, respectively. Translocations are when chromosomes swap material. If it is balanced, this means the same number of copies of material is present, but they are arranged differently - for example they have part of 3q on 2q and part of 2q on 3q, but it all adds up to the same thing. If it is unbalanced, the child has trisomy and/or monosomy for some part of the involved chromosomes. Very often, an unbalanced translocation is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, but it can also occur as a new mutation, which is called 'de novo'. For example, they may have part of 2q missing and part of 3q in its place, causing partial monosomy of 2q and partial trisomy of 3q. In an unbalanced translocation, the abnormal chromosome is called the derivative chromosome, or der for short. So they may write t(2;3)der(2) to indicate the child has the 2 with chromosome 3 material instead of the 3 with chromosome 2 material.\n2. Find medical information on your child's condition. There may not be much out there, but find what you can, because it can give you an idea what to expect for your child. Be careful to pay attention to what specific chromosome region is affected, including what bands are involved - even though they both have 22q deletion, kids with 22q11 deletion have a totally different syndrome from 22q13 deletion. Also keep in mind duplication/trisomy versus deletion/monosomy, because these are genetic opposites. When reading medical case studies, remember that they focus on the negative. You're probably not going to hear the doctor talk about how sweet and caring the child is, or how much their parents feel lucky for knowing them, because it's not medically relevant. You will learn about some of the health problems your kid could face.\n3. See if parents have written about your child's condition. Depending on how rare the condition is, there may be other parents out there who have written about what it is like to raise a child who has it.\n4. Look for adults with your child's condition. Many adults with genetic disabilities are able to use computers when they become adults. Do any of them have blogs or social media accounts? They may be able to offer good advice. Here are some benefits of learning from adults with disabilities:\n\t* They can tell you about the parenting strategies that did and didn't help. They may be able to offer detailed advice about your child. Watching them can help you envision what your child's life will be like someday.\n\n\n## Cop\n\n1. Don't assume the worst. Many doctors, when they don't know the prognosis for a condition, will act like it's more severe than it really is. Even parents of kids with very mild chromosome disorders have been told their child will never walk or talk and/or will die in infancy. If your child has a rare syndrome, take dire prognoses with a grain of salt.\n2. Recognize that infancy is the worst time. For many chromosomal conditions, the first year or two of life are the hardest, as caregivers and healthcare providers try to figure out the child's needs. It won't always be this bad, and it's likely to get easier. If you've been told that your child may die, recognize that extreme early death usually happens in the first 3 years of life, or not at all. If your child is fine at age 4, they'll probably be fine at age 24 and age 44.\n3. Give yourself time to process. You may feel a range of emotions as you realize that your child's life will look different than you thought it would. This is normal. Don't expect yourself to adjust immediately.\n4. Tell other people how they can support you. People around you may want to help, but not know what they can do. Let them know what your family needs, and give them the opportunity to help. \"Between all the doctor appointments, we barely have time to cook. It would be really nice to have someone prepare a meal or maybe invite us for dinner once in a while.\" \"We could really use a babysitter on weekends.\" \"We're so busy for with the baby that the kids can feel left out. If they could go to your house to play with your kids sometimes, it might help cheer them up.\" \"I'm really worried about the upcoming surgery. My wife can't be there due to her conference. It would really help to have someone there with me.\"\n5. Make peace with the fact that life will be different. Your child is going to learn differently, behave differently, and show you how much they love you differently. Sometimes it will be harder, but there will also be beautiful parts. Remember that not every quirk is a deficit. Some differences are positives, and others are neither good nor bad. It's okay for your child to be unique.\n6. Take time for yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help your child much if you're physically and emotionally exhausted. Try to set aside a little \"me time\" each day, even if it's only 5 minutes. Ask yourself \"What would help me feel better right now?\" Could it be a shower? A cup of tea? A hug? Try to get it.\n\n\n## Move forward\n\n1. Seek out parent support groups. If you can find other parents of kids with the same or overlapping chromosome disorders, great, but even parents of kids with completely different conditions can be a great source of support. UNIQUE has leaflets on many rare conditions.\n2. Get therapy early. Early intervention is important. As soon as your child is medically stable, sign them up for physical, occupational and/or speech therapy - even if they are still a tiny baby. This will help them reach their full potential. Although very few kids with chromosome disorders are so affected that they can't walk or talk, most have some degree of cognitive or learning disability. The more they can do for themselves, the less support they will need from others in adulthood. Take notes during therapy and ask for activities that you can do at home. Bad therapists do exist. If a therapist tells you to be cruel or punitive towards your child, find a new therapist. Childhood should be fun, not scary. You don't want your child to gain an anxiety disorder along with their new skills.\n3. Make time for your child's siblings, if there are any. At times, they may feel left out, especially if you're busy taking care of your disabled child's needs. Try to spend quality time with each of your children every day. If you don't spend time with a child on one day, try to make up for it during the weekend.\n4. Celebrate your child! Your child is different, and they have their own special combination of traits that make them who they are. Love them for who they are, and treasure the good moments. Some conditions, such as Williams syndrome, include positive aspects. Let go of the idea of the child you could have had, and focus on the real child you have right now. They need your love.\n",

Please note I used human beings as an example to give context but the species undergoing devolution may not necessarily be human.\nBased on the answers, \"devolution\" does not exist so had the word in quotes to reflect this. ",
    "response": "Devolution doesn't really ever occur, organisms simply adapt to best suit their environment over time. A good example is cave dwelling Troglodyte type species that have lost the ability to see. They haven't actually devolved to not have eyes, they simply did not need them and evolved to save valuable energy and nutrients by not growing a sight organ that would be useless in their environment. It isn't devolution, it's still evolution since they are changing to better suit their environment. So, at least as far as natural processes go, a species would need to become stuck in an environment for a few hundred thousand years that heavily discourages intellect, sociability, communication skills, culture, and inventiveness. That's a tough one to come up with since such traits are usually the most powerful ones for surviving something.\n\nSo here's the environment and scenario I'm thinking of. Your smart guy race is in the stone age, its pretty much on par with homo sapiens and where they were at about 10,000-15,000 years ago. But something catastrophic doesn't happen. The world slowly becomes a perfect Eden with very few predators, a perfect climate, and vast endless fields of grain and forests of fruit bearing trees. No ice age, no super-predators like we saw in said ice age. No famines or depredation, no rabid competition between several human subspecies for the same resources. The planet (Henceforth known as paradise) is literally perfect. Too perfect. Why would a species that has as close as possible to absolutely nothing to worry about need to even develop the ability to worry? Those big craniums and complex brains waste space and make childbirth more dangerous than necessary. There is absolutely nothing gained by possessing speech, abstract thought, or cooperative culture when all a species needs to do to be successful is to wander around placidly in small familial groups grazing mindlessly on the limitless amounts of food. Shelter is utterly not necessary since you have a perfect climate, nor is clothing, and food is so ludicrously plentiful there is no need to make tools. Within another 100,000 years your species that was formerly well on their way to developing things like agriculture, warfare, and tribal societies has reverted back to dumb grazers that simply live to eat and reproduce.",

    "original_question": "How to treat ocd and anxiety as a workaholic?",
    "response": "Working too much is a serious problem. Often, people who work too much also suffer from OCD or related anxiety disorders. If you work too much and suffer from an anxiety disorder, there are several things you can do to lead a more balanced life. You can start by seeing your doctor and going to therapy. Lifestyle changes, such as adopting stress-relieving techniques, making work boundaries, and managing your anxiety or OCD, are also important.\n\n## Manage your anxiety disorder\n\n1. Make a self-care plan. To improve your relationship with work and alleviate anxiety or OCD symptoms, you can develop a self-care plan that covers every area of your life. If you are obsessed with working, the rest of your life may be neglected. A self-care plan helps you balance your life and pay attention to each part of your life. Your self-care plan can focus on work, relationships, leisure time, the self, and your spiritual life. By breaking down your life into concrete categories, you can see where you are lacking and what needs improvement. For example, you may have 90% of your energy into your work. Your self-care plan allows you to schedule an hour each evening for leisure, where you watch television, an hour of exercise to focus on yourself, and two hours to spend with your family. On the weekends, you spend Saturday with your family and friends, and Sunday you focus on yourself. Start working on balancing your life. All of your energy now is focused on work. You should think about what’s important to you, like family and friend relationships or improving your leisure time. Put more effort into those areas of your life and less into work. Becoming more balanced in your life, improving relationships, and working on yourself can help reduce stress that leads to anxiety and OCD.\n2. Get enough sleep. Many people who work all of the time don’t sleep enough because they are too busy working. This can worsen anxiety and OCD symptoms, making you feel even worse. Worsening anxiety and OCD symptoms may also affect your work quality. To help with this, strive to get into a healthy sleep routine. Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. You should go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. This helps you adopt healthy sleeping habits.\n3. Take stress-relief breaks during the day. If you are spending all of your time focusing on work, your stress levels may be extremely high. This can increase your anxiety or OCD symptoms. To help alleviate your anxiety, take small breaks from work throughout the day to relieve stress. For example, take a 10 minute walk around the building or block. Exercise can help boost your mood and improve your anxiety. Go to lunch with coworkers or friends. Spending time connecting with people can help reduce anxiety and OCD symptoms.\n4. Engage in stress-relief techniques. When your anxiety or OCD symptoms get too bad because you are not working, you may need to use stress-relieving techniques to alleviate the symptoms. At first, you may even experience anxiety attacks as you fight compulsions or obsessive thoughts about working. Try deep breathing to help relieve anxiety. Whenever you feel overwhelmed by anxiety or OCD symptoms when you aren’t working, take a deep breath through your nose as you count to five. Hold it for a count of five, then exhale through your mouth for a count of five. Regular exercise is a great way to treat anxiety and OCD symptoms. A thirty minute walk each day can reduce your symptoms. Try getting active each day, or try stress-relieving exercises such as yoga or tai chi.\n5. Meditate. One good way to learn how to calm down and let go of work is to meditate. Meditation helps you learn how to clear your mind so you can reduce stress. Mediation is also a good treatment for anxiety and OCD. Mediation helps you get rid of negative thoughts, stress, guilt, and anxiety. Meditation may also help you be able to control compulsions and obsessive thoughts. Guided meditation is a good starting place if you’ve never meditated before. Guided meditation walks you through the process, so you are coached to relaxation and towards your mental goals.\n6. Develop hobbies. When you work too much, you may begin to lose yourself and forget to focus on anything that is enjoyable or enriching in your life. To help work on your sense of self, revisit old hobbies or develop new interests that have nothing to do with work. At first, you may have to tell yourself that spending time not working is okay. Remind yourself, “Spending time engaging in hobbies helps me be a healthier, happier person. I have completed my work and I deserve something good.”\n\n\n## Seek medical treatment\n\n1. See your doctor for a diagnosis and to begin treatment. To get proper treatment for your anxiety disorder or OCD, you need to get a proper diagnosis for both conditions. Anxiety disorders and OCD are serious mental illnesses that should be treated by a doctor or a therapist. If you work too much and you also suffer from anxiety or OCD, then your symptoms may be even more pronounced. However, with proper treatment, you can alleviate your symptoms and live a healthier life. Your doctor may suggest medication to treat the anxiety and OCD symptoms. Psychotherapy is also a common treatment for anxiety disorders. Your doctor will probably refer you to a psychiatrist or therapist who can provide therapy to address your anxiety disorder, OCD, and addiction-like behaviors. To find a therapist, start by asking your doctor for a referral. You can also search online for therapists in your area who specialize in your disorder. When you search online, you can also read reviews and patient experiences with the therapist.\n2. Undergo cognitive behavioral therapy. One effective treatment for anxiety and OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns into healthier ones. This can also help change your attitude about work, along with helping you cope with obsessive and anxious thoughts and compulsions. You may have unhealthy or untrue beliefs about work. A therapist can help you work through these beliefs and modify them into healthier, more productive beliefs. For example, if you believe you will lose your job if you don’t work all the time, your therapist can use CBT to help you change that thought to something like, “I can work hard for this many hours each week and keep my job.”\n3. Go to family therapy. Family therapy may be needed if working too much and having anxiety has negatively affected your family relationships. During family relationships, a therapist can help you learn how to interact with your family and make them a priority in your life. Your therapist can also help you figure out activities that you and your family can do together. These activities can strengthen your relationship and help you alter your attention away from work and onto leisure activity and relationships. You and your family can use therapy to learn how to communicate with each other. You may also be able to be truthful about ways your behavior has hurt each other. For example, your partner may say, \"I feel hurt that we never take any vacations because you are always working.\" You might say, \"I am frustrated because you get angry when I check my work e-mail in the evenings.\"\n\n\n## Establish work-related boundaries\n\n1. Leave work at work. When you leave work, you should do just that - leave work behind. Try not to take work home with you. Focusing on work at home can increase your anxiety and OCD symptoms while feeding your need to work. Try to make a clear boundary between work time and time not at work. For example, you can decide not to check your email or answer your phone when you’re at home. Leave all paperwork and projects at work. Don’t bring them home with you. If you must answer emails or work on paperwork at night, set aside a designated half an hour or hour to do just that. This helps keep your work time separate from your home time. It also keeps you from doing work all night.\n2. Talk to your boss about work boundaries. If working too much is triggering your anxiety or OCD, then you may want to talk to your boss about setting boundaries. You should tell our boss that you need to make clear boundaries about when you work and when you won’t work. This may include what you will and won’t do when you’re off the clock. If you are an hourly worker, you may tell your boss that you will only work during your required hours. If your boss wants you to work outside of those hours, you may negotiate overtime or say no. If you are salaried, you may set a limit on the amount of hours you will work and discuss this with your boss. You may want to say, “I have been working too much and spreading myself too thin. I would like to set some boundaries in relation to the hours I work.”\n3. Change your thoughts about work. If you have anxiety and OCD, you may be plagued by inaccurate thoughts or obsessions. You may believe if you don’t work all the time you will lose your job. You may have the compulsion to work constantly and get edgy or irritated if you are unable to work. To help treat your anxiety and OCD symptoms, work on changing your thoughts about work. Start by telling yourself that being away from work doesn’t make you lazy or unproductive. Repeat to yourself, “I do not have to work every hour of every day. I can take time to focus on myself and relationships.”\n\t* Face your obsessive or anxious thoughts. When you start to feel anxious because you aren’t working, tell yourself, “Nothing bad will happen if I am not working. These are just my anxieties. I deserve to take a break from work.”\n4. Prioritize your to-do list. Due to your anxiety, you may have a long to-do list with things you must get done. Maybe you have obsessive thoughts about what will happen if you don’t complete everything, or you have the compulsion to keep working until you have completed everything on the list. This is not healthy and just feeds anxiety and stress. Instead, start prioritizing the things you have to do and limiting your to-do list. For example, honestly assess everything on your list. What are things that have to get done today? What things have to be done by the end of the week? What things have no time limit on them? You may have to finish paperwork for work by the end of the day, complete a project by the end of the week, but making fliers can be done when you get to them. Limit your tasks to around five per day. If you have to add something to your task list for that day, you need to remove one task. Keep yourself limited so you don’t overextend yourself.\n",

    "original_question": "I recently had someone claim (on an unrelated SE site I won't link to) that it is the responsibility of a player to correctly identify their hand, that what you &quot;call&quot; your hand determines the winner:\n\nFor example, you have an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten. You call your hand and say, &quot;I have a Straight!&quot;\nBut that was a bad move on your part because you are a novice player and you did not notice that all of your cards are Spades. You actually had a Straight Flush, but now you have lost because one of the remaining players had a Full House.\nYour hand has not been determined until you call your hand.\n\nIs this true? Clearly you might play your hand differently if you misunderstand what you have, but I always thought that the cards speak for themselves once they are revealed.\nOr would it depend on the specific poker variation/house rules?",
    "response": "Casinos in the US generally have the \"cards speak\" rule. That is, when a hand is properly tabled--exposed to everyone at showdown--it is the responsibility of all players, the dealer, floormen, and anyone else present to see that the pot is awarded to the best hand shown, regardless of what the players might say.\n\nSome players object to this rule: they believe that if a player or railbird says \"Wait, Bob has a flush\", that's unfairly helping a player. But the rule is clear: once the hand is tabled, others have not only the right but the obligation to help ensure the pot is awarded correctly.\n\nThere are a couple of caveats: if a player only shows his hand to another player, or to the dealer, or to any other person, without properly tabling it for everyone, that player has no rights yet and those to whom the hand was shown should remain silent to protect other players' properly shown hands. But once the hand is tabled, it's fair game and everyone can and should assist in reading the hands.\n\nFinally, in some cases, if a floorman feels that a player has deliberately overcalled his hand to induce a player with a better hand to fold, he may penalize that player by awarding the pot to someone else, even possibly to a folded hand. Some California lowball clubs even had a rule that a player who remained silent rather than explicitly calling out a pair could be ruled against in this way.",

    "generated_instruction": "How do I help someone with bipolar disorder",
    "original_question": "How to deal with a bipolar person?",
    "response": "## Help someone with bipolar disorder\n\n1. Watch for symptoms. If the person has already been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then you may know all about the symptoms of this condition already. Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of mania and depression. During manic phases, someone may seem to have boundless energy and during depressive phases, that same person might not get out of bed for days. Manic phases may be characterized by high levels of optimism or irritability, unrealistic ideas about one’s abilities, feeling energetic despite getting little sleep, speaking rapidly and going quickly from one idea to the next, not being able to concentrate, making impulsive or poor decisions, and even hallucinating. Depressive phases are characterized by hopelessness, sadness, emptiness, irritability, losing interest in things, fatigue, lack of concentration, appetite changes, weight changes, difficulty sleeping, feeling worthless or guilty, and considering suicide.\n2. Consider the differences in bipolar disorder types. Bipolar disorder is divided into four subtypes. These definitions can help mental health practitioners to identify the disorder whether the symptoms are mild or severe. The four subtypes are:\n\t* \n\t* Bipolar I Disorder. This subtype is characterized by manic episodes that last for seven days or that are severe enough that the person needs hospitalization. These episodes are followed by depressive episodes that last at least two weeks. Bipolar II Disorder. This subtype is characterized by depressive episodes followed by mild manic episodes, but these episodes are not severe enough to warrant hospitalization. Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS). This subtype is when someone has symptoms of bipolar disorder, but they do not meet the criteria for a bipolar I or II diagnosis. Cyclothymia. This subtype is when someone has had symptoms of bipolar disorder for two years, but the symptoms are mild.\n3. Communicate your concerns. If you think that someone may be suffering from bipolar disorder, then you should say something. When you approach the person, make sure that you do so from a standpoint of concern and not judgment. Remember that bipolar disorder is a mental illness and the person cannot control their behaviors. Try saying something like, “I care about you and I have noticed that you have been struggling lately. I want to you to know that I am here for you and I want to help.”\n4. Offer to listen. Someone with bipolar disorder may feel comforted by having someone who is willing to listen to how they are feeling. Make sure that the person knows that you are happy to listen if they want to talk. When you listen, do not judge the person or try to solve their problems. Just listen and offer some genuine encouragement. For example, you might say something like, “It sounds like you have been having a really hard time. I don’t know how you feel, but I care about you and I want to help you.”\n5. Make a doctor’s appointment. The person may be incapable of making an appointment for themselves due to the symptoms of bipolar disorder, so one way that you can help is by offering to make a doctor’s appointment. If the person is resistant to the idea of seeking help for the disorder, then do not try to force them. Instead, you may consider making an appointment for your the person to have a general health check-up and see if the person feels compelled to ask the doctor about the symptoms they have been having.\n6. Encourage the person to take prescribed medications. If the person has been prescribed medications to help control their bipolar symptoms, then make sure that they take those medications. It is common for people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications because they feel better or because they miss having manic phases. Remind the person that the medications are necessary and that stopping them may make things worse.\n7. Try to be patient. Even though there may be some improvement in the person’s bipolar disorder after a few months of treatment, recovering from bipolar disorder can take years. There may also be setbacks along the way, so try to be patient with your the person as they recover.\n8. Take time for yourself. Supporting someone who has bipolar disorder can take a large toll on you, so make sure that you take time for yourself. Make sure that you have some time away from the person every day. For example, you might go to an exercise class, meet a friend for coffee, or read a book. You may also consider seeking counseling to help you deal with the stress and emotional strain of supporting someone with bipolar disorder.\n\n\n## Deal with mania\n\n1. Be a calming presence. During a manic episode, a person with bipolar disorder may become over stimulated or irritated by long conversations or certain topics. Try to talk to the person in a calming way and avoid engaging in an argument or lengthy discussion about something. Try not to bring up anything that might trigger the person’s mania. For example, you might want to avoid asking about something that is stressful for the individual or a goal that the person has been trying to accomplish. Instead, talk about the weather, a TV show, or something else that is unlikely to stress the person.\n2. Encourage the person to get lots of rest. During a manic phase, the person may feel like they only need a few hours of sleep to feel rested. However, not getting enough sleep may make matters worse. Try to encourage the person to sleep as much as possible at night and to take naps during the day if needed.\n3. Go for walks. Taking walks with your the person during manic episodes can be a good way to help them use excess energy and provide a good opportunity for the two of you to talk as well. Try to invite the person to go on a walk with you once per day or at least a few times per week. Regular exercise can also help when someone is having symptoms of depression, so try to encourage exercise no matter what the person’s mood is like.\n4. Watch for impulsive behavior. During manic episodes, the person may be prone to impulsive behavior such as drug use, shopping in excess, or going on a long trip. Try to encourage the person to think a bit longer before making any major purchases or starting a new project when they are in the midst of a manic episode. If overspending is often an issue, then you might encourage the person to leave credit cards and extra cash at home when these episodes strike. If drinking or using drugs seems to intensify the situation, then you might encourage the person to avoid using alcohol or other substances.\n5. Try not to take comments personally. When someone is in the middle of a manic period, they may say hurtful things or try to start arguments with you. Try not to take these comments personally and do not engage in arguments with the person. Remind yourself that these comments are due to the illness and do not represent how the person really feels.\n\n\n## Deal with depression\n\n1. Suggest working towards a small goal. During a depressive episode, it may be hard for the person to accomplish large goals, so setting small manageable goals may help. Accomplishing a small goal may also help the person feel better. For example, if the person is complaining that she needs to clean her whole house, then you might suggest just tackling something small like a coat closet or bathroom.\n2. Encourage positive strategies for dealing with depression. When someone is depressed, it may be tempting to turn to negative coping mechanisms, such as alcohol, isolating oneself, or not taking medications. Instead, try to encourage the person to use positive coping mechanisms. For example, you can suggest calling their therapist, doing a little exercise, or engaging in a hobby when a depressive mood strikes.\n3. Provide genuine encouragement. Encouraging the person during depressive phases will help them to know that someone there cares. Make sure that you avoid making promises or relying on clichés when you encourage your friend or the person. For example, don’t say, “Everything will be fine,” “It’s all in your head,” or “When life give you lemons, make lemonade!”\n\t* Instead, say things like, “I care about you,” “I am here for you,” “You are a good person and I am happy that you are in my life.”\n4. Try to establish a routine. During depressive phases, the person may prefer to stay in bed, isolate themselves, or just watch TV all day. Do your best to help the person establish a daily routine so that they always have something to do. For example, you might establish a time for your the person to get up and shower, a time to go get the mail, a time to take a walk, and time to do something fun, like reading a book or playing a game.\n5. Watch for signs that the person may be suicidal. During depressive phases, people are more prone to thoughts of suicide. Make sure that you take any comments about suicide seriously. If the person is acting suicidal or indicating that they have plans to kill themselves and/or harm others, then call emergency services for help. Do not try to deal with someone who is suicidal or violent on your own.\n",

Among the more benevolent leaders was Hyperion, the Lord of Light. He was called upon for wisdom and discernment; mortals valued his insight and praised his control of the heavenly bodies.\nYet Hyperion had one great love: Theia, his consort. She was a Titaness of radiance, a mother goddess who shone like the sun on all who sought after her. The two Titans were very much in love, and their love gave vibrancy to the life around them. They were happy - for a time.\nThat time ended when the Gods declared war on the Titans, with Zeus at the forefront of battle. Cronus, Hyperion's brother and Lord over all the Titans, called Hyperion into battle against the upstart Gods. Knowing the war would end in defeat, Hyperion left anyway, answering the call of his brother and king.\nBut before he left, Hyperion gave Theia a gift: a ring of radiant light to wear around her finger. He told her that the ring would tell her if he was safe; that the ring would glow with a silver light when he was in danger. Theia took it gratefully and bid her lover farewell. It was the last time she would see him.\nHyperion fell during the war and was banished with the other Titans to the pits of Tartarus. During the battle, Theia watched in helpless anguish as the ring shone brighter and brighter until it was nearly as luminous as the sun. In her despair, she removed the ring and prayed to the Mother Gaia that she would cause the ring to grow as large as her love for Hyperion. Gaia listened, and so the ring grew.\nNow the ring encircles the Earth, a strip of radiance that gives off silver moonlight every evening. Mankind looks up to the ring and is reminded of Theia's anguish, as well as her love for her fallen lover.",

    "generated_instruction": "How can I fly as high as possible in an aeroplane without crashing?",
    "original_question": "What factors determine the maximum altitude for a plane?\nIs it limited by wing design, engine thrust, and so on?\nIs there a formula by which one can calculate the maximum altitude a plane can reach?",
    "response": "The higher you get, the lower the density of the air becomes. This lower density results in a lower lift being generated for the same airspeed and angle of attack. Effectively, the higher you fly the higher your minimum speed becomes. So while climbing, your speed needs to increase to compensate for the lower air density. As long a you can fly faster, the lower density at altitude can be compensated for. \nBasically there are two things that limit your maximum speed: thrust and speed of sound and with that your maximum altitude.\nFirst is thrust; the higher you get, the lower the thrust your engines deliver. You might note that drag goes down with the air density as well but since you are flying faster and faster during the climb the drag doesn't decrease at all. If your maximum altitude is limited by thrust then at some point during the climb the thrust and drag are getting close to equal and that is where the climb stops. When you can no longer climb with more than 100ft per minute (for propeller aircraft) or 500ft per minute (for jet / turbofan aircraft) you have reached your service ceiling. If the aircraft maximum altitude is determined by thrust, the absolute ceiling will take very long to reach. \nAt high altitudes air breathing engines will get difficulties eventually. Due to the lower air density the mass flow through the engine is reduced up to a point where it causes a flame out. \nThe other limitation is the speed of sound, at least for subsonic aircraft. In the process of generating lift, air flowing over the top of the wing is accelerated. At one point, when the aircraft is still flying below the speed of sound, shock waves will start to form over the wing. This results in increase of drag and reduces the lift. So provided you have enough engine power at your disposal you can climb to an altitude where your minimum speed is also your maximum speed. This is called the coffin corner. In the coffin corner:\n\n* if you fly any faster, you will exceed the maximum Mach number ($M_{mo}$) of your aircraft, resulting in high speed buffet, vibrations and possible loss of control. \n* if you fly any slower, the maximum lift that the wing can provide will be insufficient to maintain altitude. Descent or the aircraft will stall. \n* if you fly any higher and you will be too fast and too slow at the same time. \n* if you turn, you increase the wing loading, thereby increasing the minimum speed needed to create the required lift. Also the outer wing will easily exceed the maximum speed while at the same time the inner wing is below stall speed. This can quickly develop into a spin. \n\nSince accurate knowledge of engine performance, drag and wing characteristics of the aircraft is needed, there is not a simple formula to derive the maximum altitude for an aircraft.  \n\nApart from the aircraft performance related limitations above there is a certified maximum operating altitude for the pressurized cabin. This takes into account the structural properties of the hull (pressure difference between inside and outside) and the achievable emergency descent rate in case of a depressurization event.",

    "original_question": "How to host a what not to wear party?",
    "response": "Many people love the TV show \"What Not to Wear\", so it would obviously make a great party idea for them! Here's a guide on how to make your What Not to Wear party one to remember!\n\n## Step\n\n1. You can do this party one of two ways: Make it just like the show, and invite one of your friends/family members that makes fashion faux-pas a little too often, then surprise them by saying they they're going to get a fashion makeover! This is a great idea for a surprise birthday party, because then all the guests could get the birthday person fashionable clothes or gift cards to cool stores. Tell all your guests to wear their most horrible outfits. Floor-length skirts, see-through shirts, unmatched colours and patterns, old lady dresses, nurse's shoes, and bad makeup. Also, tell them to bring their favourite/most fashionable outfits. This is a good theme for younger kids/teenagers because it gets the guests more involved. If you want, you can mix components of both parties.\n2. For both parties, assign your own family/friends to be the cast of \"What not to Wear\". If possible, get a man and a woman and assign them as the hosts (Clinton Kelly and Stacy London), then a woman to be the makeup artist (Carmine), and possibly even a man to be the hairstylist (Ted Gibson). However, it's not recommended to have your hairstylist actually cut anyone's hair. Instead, have them braid their hair, or curl, crimp, or straighten it.\n3. For both parties, decorate your house/party space just like the \"What not to Wear\" studio. Make sure to have a place for your guests to get their makeup done by your very own Carmine. Place pictures of fashionable outfits around your house as well.\n4. At the end of either party theme, eat cake/snacks, chat, dance, or do whatever you please now that everyone looks great, and you can go to bed knowing that you had a great party!\n\n\n## \"what not to wear\" replica theme\n\n1. When you send out invitations to your guests, tell them to send you pictures of your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (the FF-PP) wearing their worst outfits.\n2. Once the party starts, sit your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (FF-PP) down, and tell them that you've been secretly filming them for the past 2 weeks (or however long you want). Then show them the pictures that your friends/family sent in of them. Then tell them that they're going to get a huge makeover!\n3. Go through your FF-PP's outfits and 'throw them away' (You don't have to if you don't want to).\n4. Instead of going shopping for new outfits like they do on the show, open your guests' presents (if they've gotten the birthday person clothes and gift cards). That will be their new wardrobe.\n5. Give your FF-PP a makeover! Do their makeup, nails, and hair.\n6. Reveal your made-over FF-PP to your guests.\n\n\n## Worst-dressed to best-dressed theme\n\n1. Send out invitations with the 'What not to Wear' logo on them, as well as pictures of Clinton Kelly and Stacy London, the hosts of the show. You can also have pictures of horrible outfits and put big red 'X's over them.\n2. Once everyone has arrived at the party, award your 'Worst-dressed Person' with a prize (something fashion-related, such as a pair of cute earrings).\n3. Have a 'worst-dressed' photo shoot. This is a lot of fun.\n4. Have 'Stacy' and 'Clinton' critique everyone's outfits, just like on the show.\n5. Tell your guests to get dressed in their favourite/most fashionable outfits. If somebody forgets theirs, lend them one of your chic outfits!\n6. After your guests are all dressed up, it's time for a makeover! Have some makeup on-hand, as well as some nail polish for manicures. Also, give them to option of curling, straightening, and/or crimping their hair.\n7. After everyone's makeovers are finished, announce the \"Best-Dressed Award\". Give them a prize similar to the winner of the \"Worst-Dressed Award\".\n8. Once the \"Best-Dressed Award\" has been handed out, it's time for a photo shoot! Take pictures of your guests in their best outfits.\n9. Have your guests be revealed to 'Stacy' and 'Clinton'. Make sure that Stacy and Clinton both say positive stuff about the guest's outfits. Make sure that the person playing Stacy London says \"Shut up!\" frequently (she says \"Shut up!\" whenever she's impressed with an outfit).\n10. Reveal your pictures of your guests in their worst outfits (Before) and their best outfits (after). This will be a lot of fun and will get a lot of laughs.\n",

    "original_question": "How to flip someone off with style?",
    "response": "Flipping someone off is a classic nonverbal signal for showing anger and frustration toward a person. You might \"flip the bird\" to someone who has cut you off, insulted you, or otherwise provoked your ire. At its simplest, flipping someone off is just pointedly displaying your middle finger in their direction. More advanced techniques take on an element of comedy or performance art. Remember: when you flip someone off, you are calling him or her out – so use with caution, or be prepared for the consequences!\n\n## Basic flip-off move\n\n1. Give someone the finger. There is a simple straightforwardness to the classic \"flip-off.\" Turn the back of your fist toward someone, as though you are shaking a fist at them. Then, extend your middle finger. Hold the pose and look the person in the eye. This is a quick and easy way to get the point across. Wave your finger around for emphasis. Hold it out firmly and emphatically to make sure that you get the point across.\n2. Try using both hands. For added effect, whip out the \"double-finger\" flip-off. Flip the person off with both middle fingers at the same to show them that you are unusually angry. Do \"the X\": cross your middle fingers into an \"X,\" and then hold them against your chest facing the offender.\n3. Switch fingers. For a somewhat more dynamic insult, flash your left and right middle fingers at the person in rapid succession. Alternately, keep both middle fingers extended and wave them around for emphasis.\n\n\n## Discreet flip-off move\n\n1. Act like you are itching your nose. Reach up to your face as though you are going to itch your nose or your face. Look in the direction of the person that you want to flip off. Then, use your middle finger to scratch your nose while staring pointedly. The person that you are flipping off might not notice this move. However, it might give other onlookers a laugh.\n2. Flip the person off behind their back. You might feel a bit better simply by releasing your anger somehow, even if the person in question doesn't actually see you. Consider whether you want to provoke a confrontation, or just get your feelings out.\n\n\n## Theatrical flip-off move\n\n1. Do the \"jack-in-the-box\" flip-off. Hold your fist out in front of you, knuckles facing the offender – but do not raise your middle finger yet. Then, make a fist with the other hand, and crank it in circles next to the first hand as though you are winding up an old-timey jack-in-the-box toy. As you crank, hum \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" the tune traditionally associated with jack-in-the-boxes. Hum and crank faster and faster as you approach the end of the tune. Then, at the final \"Pop\" of the \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" tune, extend your middle finger as though it is the jack popping out of the box. Finish humming the tune while flipping the person off. Make sure that you have the person's undivided attention. This move takes a bit of time to pull off, and you want to make sure to get the full effect.\n2. Practice \"the balloon.\" Hold your fist in front of your face and put the tip of your thumb in your mouth. Act as though you are blowing up a balloon: \"blow\" into your thumb, and slowly extend all of your fingers as though your breath is inflating them. Then, hold you middle finger of the \"balloon hand\" with your other hand, and move the thumb away from your mouth. Slowly close the other fingers on your \"balloon hand\" until only your middle finger is left pointing at the person whom you want to flip off.\n3. Pretend to \"find\" your middle finger. Act as though you are looking for something: in your pocket, or between the couch cushions, or in a desk drawer. Make sure that you get the person's attention. Then, make a show of being relieved that you have found the thing you're looking for. Turn to show the person what you found: and flip them off! Alternately, lean down in front of the person as though you are picking something up off of the ground. Come up flashing your middle finger, and say, \"Did you drop this?\"\n4. Try \"the trumpet.\" Blow on your thumb while pretending to play the trumpet, and flail your fingers as though you are hitting the valves. Periodically hold up only your middle finger. Add some musical effects for style!\n5. Try the \"double extreme.\" Extend the middle fingers of both hands. Then, bring your arms behind your back and through your legs. You should have both middle fingers clearly presented. Note: only people with long arms can pull this off.\n",

",
    "response": "Faulty Premise #1: John the Baptist was a reincarnation of Elijah\n\nWhen Jesus asked Peter who people said he was, he answered that some people thought that Jesus was Elijah come back. Peter knew better and said Jesus was the Christ. In any event, John the Baptist himself directly denied the claim (see John 1:19-21). \nWhat Jesus more likely was saying in Matthew 11 is that John the Baptist was a prophet in the tradition of Elijah. Elijah was the greatest of the prophets (even if his disciple Elisha inherited a double portion of his spirit). All of the prophets that followed came in the name and spirit of Elijah, in the same way that some of Paul's letters apparently were created after his death. They were in the spirit and tradition even if not the actual man. \nNote also Elijah never died - he was taken up into heaven, and people thought he would return. As such, no Elijah was not being thought to have reincarnated- only returned. Elijah's return was long a part of Jewish custom. Even today, during a Passover sedar, a chair is left empty for Elijah. But again, since he did not die, Jews look for his return, not his reincarnation. \n\nFaulty Premise #2: The Jewish world view has  any concept of reincarnation at all\n\nThe most basic rule of hermeneutics suggests that a text cannot mean what it could not mean to the original audience. If the Jews had no concept of reincarnation, then any interpretation that says it does has a very, very high bar to clear.\nIn his book The Gift of the Jews, Thomas Cahill advances the thesis that the primary distinctive philosophy of the Jews was precisely that history was not circular. Their linear idea of a human life was a departure from others and was an explicit rejection of reincarnation. As such, a text would need to be exceedingly explicit to a culture that rejected circular life patterns, and the obscure interpretation above (especially in light of the more obvious intepretation) simply doesn't hold water.\nFurthermore, the book of Hebrews - written to the people into which both Jesus and John the Baptist were born - explicitly reject reincarnation. As the writer points out in 9:27, \n\n  It is appointed unto a man once to die and then the judgement.\n\nHere we do have an explicit rejection of reincarnation by the followers of Jesus. There is one death. There is one judgement. Hence, in any Christian worldview, you don't come back.",

For making a fluffy bow, use a minimum of 9 feet (2.7 m)—the more ribbon, the fluffier the bow! Make a small circle, about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, at one end of the ribbon. If you're at the store and aren't sure if the ribbon is wired or not, simply pinch a portion of it together—if it keeps its shape, it's wired. Keep in mind as you work that you'll need to stop when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric remaining.\n3. Pinch the end of the circle together in your non-dominant hand. Where the end of the ribbon touches the rest of the ribbon, pinch that seam together and hold it between the fingers of your non-dominant hand. This leaves your dominant hand free to shape the rest of the bow. You're going to use your non-dominant hand to hold together the fabric the entire time you're making the bow.\n4. Create a figure-eight by making loops on either side of the circle. Make a loop on one side of the circle, pinch the fabric in the middle, and then make a loop on the other side of the circle to create the figure-eight image. Continue pinching together the fabric in the middle that meets at your fingers. When you look at the bow from the side, it'll look like the number “8.”\n5. Continue making progressively larger figure-eight loops. Make at least 5 or 6 layers of ribboned loops. If you are using a lot of fabric, you may even make closer to 9 or 10! Remember to keep gathering the material in the middle by pinching it between your fingers. At this stage, your loops will be layered rather than spread out and the bow might look a little strange, but don't worry! You're on the right path.\n6. Stop making loops when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric left. Take the end of the ribbon and place it between your fingers in your non-dominant hand, forming a large circle. 12 inches (30 cm) of ribbon will produce bow tails that are about 6 inches (15 cm) long each.\n7. Thread the piece of floral wire around the fabric you've been pinching. Cinch it tight and twist it several times to make sure it's secure. You can now release that bundle of fabric you've been holding on to! If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process: thread it around the pinched fabric and twist it off to ensure it'll stay in place.\n8. Cut the middle of the last big loop you made to form the tails of the bow. Cut in the middle of the fabric and watch as the ends fall down, creating the tails of your bow. You could even cut small triangles out of each end to add an additional flourish to the design. If you want longer tails, leave more fabric at the end when you stop making your loops. If you want shorter tails, you can simply trim them to the length you want.\n9. Shape the ribbon by rearranging the loops. Spread out the loops until you create a large, fluffy, full-looking bow. Make sure to pull loops upwards and down, and do your best to leave no see-through spaces between the loops. The great thing about using wire ribbon is that you can reform the loops easily if they get bent out of shape.\n\n\n## Create a bow from unwire ribbon\n\n1. Cut off a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) piece of floral wire. Leave this piece of wire off to the side somewhere you can find it easily later on. You'll use it to secure your bow once you're finished making it. If you don't have floral wire, use a pipe cleaner.\n2. Take your ribbon and make a twist at the end of it. Use at least 2 feet (0.61 m) of ribbon for this bow. Twist the end, leaving about 6 inches (15 cm) of fabric for one of your tail ends. If you're using ribbon that isn't patterned on both sides, just make sure that the patterned or colored side is on the outside of the twist.\n3. Make multiple loops, twisting the fabric at the end of each loop. Hold the forming bow in your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to make the loops and twists. How large you make the loops depends on how big you want the bow to be—use smaller loops for a more concentrated bow, and use bigger loops for a larger, fluffier bow. For this bow, you won't be making a figure-eight pattern. Instead, you'll just be making each loop consecutively right next to one another.\n4. Stop making loops on an even number. Make anywhere from 6-10 loops (or more, if you're going for a really large bow!) before you stop. The even number helps create symmetry in your bow.\n5. Cut off your bow from the rest of the ribbon. Cut the ribbon so that there are roughly equal-sized tails on each side. If you're worried about matching the sides, just leave extra room so you can trim the ribbon tails to match later on. It's okay if the edge is a little jagged—you can tidy it up later on.\n6. Thread your floral wire through the center of the bow. Position the wire so that half of the loops are on one side and the rest are on the other. Twist off the floral wire several times so that it stays firmly in place. If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process. You can leave the excess floral wire in place and use it to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n7. Spread out the loops to create a fluffy bow! Position the loops in all directions so that it looks full. Because this bow is made of unwired fabric, it might look a little loose, but that's part of the beauty of it! If you want, you can also cut small triangles out of the ends of the tails for an added flourish.\n\n\n## Craft a rustic bow with burlap\n\n1. Cut off 3 separate sections of burlap ribbon. Make one piece 60 inches (150 cm), one 24 inches (61 cm), and the last one 8 inches (20 cm). Additionally, cut the 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap in half lengthwise. These measurements will create a large, rustic bow that will hang down off of your wreath.\n2. Hold the large ribbon in the center, and fold the sides down and across. Leave about 16 inches (41 cm) of fabric in the center before making your folds, as this will be the main part of your bow. Fold each side down and across so that the end of each one is on the opposite side. It's usually easier if you do this at a workstation so you can lay the ribbon down flat.\n3. Fold the 24 in (61 cm) piece of ribbon so the ends meet in the middle. Place the folded ribbon, seam-side down, over top of and in the middle of the 16 in (41 cm) section from the largest ribbon, layering one on top of the other. This second piece of fabric helps create depth in your bow by giving it a second dimension, rather than just having a flat, single-layer bow.\n4. Gather the fabric in the middle of your ribbons to make a bow shape. Pinch the fabric together in the very middle to create the 2 sides of your bow, and hold the fabric together using your non-dominant hand. One side of the bow should be a mirror reflection of the other side.\n5. Wrap your floral wire around the center of the bow. Thread it around the middle, and twist it off several times to ensure it's secure and won't come undone. If you don't have floral wire, you could also use a pipe cleaner. You can either trim off the excess ends of the wire, or let them stick out to the sides so you can use them to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n6. Cover the floral wire with the halved 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap. Wrap it around several times until there isn't any excess ribbon to be wrapped around. If you want, you could also take the other half of that 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap and wrap it around the middle, too. A fun variation here is to use a colored or patterned ribbon to cover the floral wire for a little pop of color!\n7. Use your glue gun to secure the burlap on the backside. Flip your bow over and apply some hot glue to the burlap that's covering the floral wire. Use your scissors to trim off any burlap that is still sticking up. Let the hot glue dry before you flip it back over so it doesn't accidentally get stuck to your table. If you don't have a hot glue gun, you could use double-sided tape.\n8. Cut out triangles from the ends of the “tails” for an added flourish. Instead of leaving the ends of your burlap as straight edges, cut out a triangle shape from each end for a rustic and authentic feel. It's okay if the triangles don't match exactly, but try to keep them about the same general size.\n",

    "response": "It depends on the tax system that applies to you, but there can be consequences, and they can be very severe.\n\nGenerally economic activity is defined as oriented on profit, so giving anything for free could qualify as self-promotion or donation.\n\nIn Poland, for example, only some costs of the company spend on promotion can be considered as tax costs. So in worst case you could end with tax office refusing to acknowledge, for example, 50% of your expenses as tax costs. You would end up with fine and penalty percentages.\n\nWith donation, the danger is even greater. There was a case of baker who was giving the unsold bread to charity for free. He was told to pay the VAT from the bread that was given for free (from the price it was normally being sold - but the tax officer is free to estimate the basis price as he/she wants). With penalty percentages the sum was so big, that he has become insolvent. However, the obligation to pay VAT was only in case of wares, not services, and the law has changed recently, but in other countries the regulations may be even stricter.\n\nThere is also a potential consequence if you receive something for free.

    "original_question": "When to use UICollectionView instead of UITableView?",
    "response": "That depends on the requirements. How the application flows determines which type of UI to integrate into the application.\nPeople mainly use the ```UICollectionview``` for creating types of UIs with multiple images shown in a grid. This would have complex logic using ```UITableView```, but with ```UICollectionview```, it would be easy.\nWhen using ```UICollectionview```, you don't need to set buttons with tags or other things by getting selected items values. You can simply get ```-(void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath``` and in ```UITableViewDelegate```:\n````-(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath`\n```\nYou get the selected row instead of the item, so for creating grid or modified items, using ```UICollectionview``` is best.\nFor the listing details of each item, people use ```UITableView``` because it shows more info on each item.\nApple Docs:\nUICollectionView Class Reference\n\n  The UICollectionView class manages an ordered collection of data items and presents them using customizable layouts. Collection views provide the same general function as table views except that a collection view is able to support more than just single-column layouts. Collection views support customizable layouts that can be used to implement multi-column grids, tiled layouts, circular layouts, and many more. You can even change the layout of a collection view dynamically if you want.\n\nUITableView Class Reference\n\n  A table view displays a list of items in a single column. UITableView is a subclass of UIScrollView, which allows users to scroll through the table, although UITableView allows vertical scrolling only. The cells comprising the individual items of the table are UITableViewCell objects; UITableView uses these objects to draw the visible rows of the table. Cells have content—titles and images—and can have, near the right edge, accessory views. Standard accessory views are disclosure indicators or detail disclosure buttons; the former leads to the next level in a data hierarchy and the latter leads to a detailed view of a selected item. Accessory views can also be framework controls, such as switches and sliders, or can be custom views. Table views can enter an editing mode where users can insert, delete, and reorder rows of the table. ",

Because it behaves exactly like the companion, but it must have a name.\nIs there maybe a difference in its \"static\" (I'm from the java side) lifecycle? ",
    "response": "There are two different types of ```object``` uses, expression and declaration.\nObject Expression\nAn object expression can be used when a class needs slight modification, but it's not necessary to create an entirely new subclass for it.  Anonymous inner classes are a good example of this.\n```button.setOnClickListener(object: View.OnClickListener() {\n    override fun onClick(view: View) {\n        // click event\n    }\n})\n```\nOne thing to watch out for is that anonymous inner classes can access variables from the enclosing scope, and these variables do not have to be ```final```.  This means that a variable used inside an anonymous inner class that is not considered ```final``` can change value unexpectedly before it is accessed.\nObject Declaration\nAn object declaration is similar to a variable declaration and therefore cannot be used on the right side of an assignment statement.  Object declarations are very useful for implementing the Singleton pattern.\n```object MySingletonObject {\n    fun getInstance(): MySingletonObject {\n        // return single instance of object\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd the ```getInstance``` method can then be invoked like this.\n```MySingletonObject.getInstance()\n```\nCompanion Object\nA companion object is a specific type of object declaration that allows an object to act similar to static objects in other languages (such as Java).  Adding ```companion``` to the object declaration allows for adding the &quot;static&quot; functionality to an object even though the actual static concept does not exist in Kotlin.  Here's an example of a class with instance methods and companion methods.\n```class MyClass {\n  companion object MyCompanionObject {\n    fun actsAsStatic() {\n      // do stuff\n    }\n  }\n  fun instanceMethod() {\n    // do stuff\n  }\n}\n```\nInvoking the instance method would look like this.\n```var myClass = MyClass()\nmyClass.instanceMethod()\n```\nInvoking the companion object method would look like this.\n```MyClass.actsAsStatic()\n```\nSee the Kotlin docs for more info.",

Demonstrate with the opposites that the students labeled on the number line earlier.\n* Define the absolute value of a number as its distance from zero. Let students find the absolute values of the two opposites from the introduction.\n* Plot another point on the original number line. Ask students to find the absolute value of that number. Let one student explain their answer to the class.\n* Ask students if they notice a pattern about absolute value.

Use an elevator example with the ground floor marked as zero. Ask students to measure the distance between underground or overground floors to the ground floor.\n\n###Guided Practice (10 minutes):\n* Provide students with an introductory absolute value worksheet. The worksheet should be as simple as possible.\n* Have students pair with partners to complete this worksheet. Check in on students while they work.\n\n###Independent Work (20 minutes)\n* Provide students with an absolute value word problems worksheet. This worksheet should help students connect absolute value to real-life situations.\n* Have students work independently on these word problems.\n\n###Assessment (10 minutes):\n* Ask students to find the absolute value of some numbers (e.g. -6, -3.5, 17) on a sheet of paper.\n* Write the temperatures -6°C, 1°C, and -3°C on the board.

How do you fold a polo in the traditional way, do you roll them, how do you keep them clean, do you wash them in water or hand wash them, do you dry them in a machine or hang them up, and how do you remove any wrinkles with steaming or ironing?",
    "original_question": "How to fold polo shirts?",
    "response": "Polo shirts are great because you can wear them almost anywhere. To keep your polo shirts looking good, make sure to fold them correctly. Start by placing them on a firm, flat surface. Fold in the sides and sleeves before bringing the bottom seam right below the collar. Store your polos by rolling them into tight bundles or stacking them on top of one another in a moth-free setting.\n\n## Fold your polo in the traditional way\n\n1. Lay the shirt on a flat surface. Find a flat, smooth surface, like a laundry table. Position the shirt on the middle of the surface with the button-side (front) facing down. Stretch out the sleeves to each side. Make sure that the edges of the shirt do not fall off the sides of the surface. Fully button up the shirt from top to bottom. Button up the cuffs as well.\n2. Fold the sleeves back. Grab each sleeve and fold it to the middle of the back of the shirt (the button-free side that is currently facing upwards). Try to keep the each sleeve horizontal. This will make the cuffs overlap in the middle center of the shirt. As you adjust the sleeves, be careful not to pull the side seams of the shirt towards the back. You are just folding the sleeves in at this point, not the core of the shirt. If you have a short-sleeved polo, you will still fold the sleeves toward the middle of the back of the shirt. However, the sleeves will not overlap in the middle.\n3. Smooth the shirt out with your hands. The key to folding any shirt, including polo style, is to run your hands over the fabric after every fold. This helps to smooth out the wrinkles and to ensure tight, secure folds. If you come upon a heavy wrinkle in the fabric, make minor adjustments until it disappears.\n4. Fold in the sides of the shirt. With the front of the shirt still facing down, gently grasp one side of the shirt with both hands. Fold this side inwards until it touches the middle of the shirt’s back. Do the same thing with the other side. If you do this correctly, you should see a “V” at the top back of the shirt right below the collar. If you have a short-sleeved polo, this fold will help to keep your sleeves in place moving forward. Make sure to hold your sleeves in place as you complete this step or they may move around as you lift the sides to fold inwards.\n5. Fold the shirt in half. Keep the button-side of the shirt facing down. Grasp the bottom edge of the polo shirt. Fold the edge upwards until the shirt is essentially at half of the full length. When you are finished you want the bottom edge of the shirt to rest right at the lower edge of the collar.\n6. Do an extra fold depending on the shirt’s length. If your shirt is extra large or extra long, then a single bottom fold may not be enough. You may need to divide the length of the shirt into thirds or fourths, adding in 1 or 2 additional folds.\n7. Flip and store. Grab your folded shirt and flip it over. The collar should now face upwards. This is a great way to store your polo shirts, as it keeps the collars and sleeves crisp. It’s even safe to stack multiple shirts on top of one another for storage, as the pressure will keep any wrinkles at bay.\n\n\n## Roll your polo shirt\n\n1. Save space by rolling. If you have a small closet or just a single drawer to use, then rolling is good option. Many people also prefer to roll all of their clothes when packing suitcases, as it makes it easy to select outfits quickly. The downside of rolling is that it can leave polo shirts a bit wrinkled. Address this problem by giving yourself some time to steam a shirt after unrolling it.\n2. Fold the shirt in from the bottom. Lay your polo shirt on a flat surface with the buttons facing up. Grasp the bottom edge of the shirt and fold it upwards about 4 inches (10 cm). This will shorten the total length of the shirt and help you to create a tighter roll.\n3. Fold in the sides. Grab one side of your polo shirt, place the sleeve facing outward, and fold the fabric inward toward the center. Do the same thing with the other side of the shirt. This means that the outer edges of your shirt will now meet in the center with overlapping sleeves.\n4. Start rolling from the collar. Grab the collar in both of your hands and begin rolling downwards. Try to keep your hands firm on the fabric, so that the final roll is tight and secure. When you reach the bottom of the shirt, press lightly against the sides of the roll. The final roll should be around 6 inches (15 cm) in width.\n\n\n## Clean your polo shirt before store\n\n1. Wash the shirt according to the instructions. Locate the tag on your polo. It will probably be at the collar or on the inner side-seam. Read how to wash your polo and follow these directions exactly. For 100% cotton polos, this will usually mean washing them on a warm water setting. For mixed fabric blends, it is usually safer to go with a cold water setting. It’s also okay to hand wash most polos, as long as you stick with the same suggested water temperature.\n2. Dry the shirt. You really want to avoid shrinking your polos, so make sure that you follow the drying instructions as well. If you machine dry your polos, use the lowest heat setting. It’s better, though, to hang your polo shirts up on a drying rack until they are fully dry. This will keep your shirts looking the best for the longest period of time. Be aware that drying your polos on a rack might make them look more wrinkly. However, this can be quickly fixed with a round of steaming or ironing.\n3. Remove any wrinkles with steaming or ironing. Get out your ironing board and set your iron to a medium or low heat setting. Go over your polo with the iron, keeping it moving to prevent burning the fabric. Look at the tag for any additional instructions. Some polos need to be turned inside out before ironing. You can also hang up your polo and use a steam machine to work out any wrinkles. Pass the steamer wand close to, but not touching, the fabric until it smooths out. Polo shirts have a tendency to get particularly wrinkly around the collar, so pay additional attention to this area. Also, make sure to reinsert any collar stays after you are finished steaming or ironing your shirt.\n",

Claiming a similar name is an assertion in advance that your work will be at a similar level of significance. \n\nThe problem, then, is that if you say \"Doe's growth model\", it is ambiguous whether that is intended to be a construction like \"Hawking radiation\" or whether it just means \"the growth model that happens to have been developed by Doe.\"\n\nThis potential problem can be avoided by rephrasing to avoid the parallel construction: \"the growth model by Doe et al (2010)\", or better yet, \"the growth model presented in (Doe, 2010).\"  The point here is that the significant item under discussion is the growth model, not Doe, and the sentence should be phrased to make that as clear as possible.\n\nFinally, note that these sorts of phrasings can work both for double blind review and for review where the authors' identities are known: even when the identity of the author is known, the important thing should be the relationship between the work, not the fraction of authors that are shared between two papers (unless you are specifically trying to talk about independent co-discovery).",

    "original_question": "In Dupire's local volatility model, the volatility is is a deterministic function of the underlying price and time, chosen to match observed European option prices.\nTo be more specific, given a smooth surface $(K,T)\\mapsto C(K,T)$ where K is the strike and T is time to maturity. Dupire equation implies that there exits an unique continuous function $\\sigma_{loc}$ defined by\n$$\\sigma_{loc}^{2}(K,T)=\\frac{\\partial_{T}C(K,T)+rK\\partial_{K}C(K,T)}{\\frac{1}{2}K^{2}\\partial_{KK}C(K,T)}$$ for all $(K,T)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times(0,\\infty)$ such that the solution to the stochastic differential equation $dS_{t}/S_{t}=rdt+\\sigma(t,S_{t})dW_{t}$ exactly generates the European call option prices.\nWhat do the dynamics of the local volatility mean? Are dynamics equivalent to the volatility surface? Why the dynamics of local volatility model is highly unrealistic?",
    "response": "A general model (with continuous paths) can be written\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r_t dt + \\sigma_t dW_t^S\n$$\nwhere the short rate $r_t$ and spot volatility $\\sigma_t$ are stochastic processes. \nIn the Black-Scholes model both $r$ and $\\sigma$ are deterministic functions of time (even constant in the original model). This produces a flat smile for any expiry $T$. And we have the closed form formula for option prices\n$$\n  C(t,S;T,K) = BS(S,T-t,K;\\Sigma(T,K))\n$$\nwhere $BS$ is the BS formula and $\\Sigma(T,K) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T-t}\\int_t^T \\sigma(s)^2 ds}$. This is not consistent with the smile observed on the market. In order to match market prices, one needs to use a different volatility for each expiry and strike. This is the implied volatility surface $(T,K) \\mapsto \\Sigma(T,K)$. \nIn the local volatility model, rates are deterministic, instant volatility is stochastic but there is only one source of randomness\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r(t) dt + \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) dW_t^S\n$$\nthis is a special case of the general model with\n$$\n  d\\sigma_t = (\\partial_t \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + r(t)S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + \\frac{1}{2}S_t^2\\partial_S^2\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)) dt + \\frac{1}{2}S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)^2 dW_t^S\n$$\nWhat is appealing with this model is that the function $\\sigma_{Dup}$ can be perfectly calibrated to match all market vanilla prices (and quite easily too). \nThe problem is that while correlated to the spot, statistical study show that the volatility also has its own source of randomness independent of that of the spot. Mathematically, this means the instant correlation between the spot and vol is not 1 contrary to what happens in the local volatility model. \nThis can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. The forward smile. Forward implied volatility is implied from prices of forward start options: ignoring interest rates,\n$$\n  C(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K) := E^Q[(\\frac{S_{T+\\theta}}{S_{T}}-K)_+] =: C_{BS}(S=1,\\theta,K;\\Sigma(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K))\n$$\nAlternatively, it is sometimes defined as the expectation of implied volatility at a forward date. In a LV model, as the maturity $T$ increases but $\\theta$ is kept constant, the forward smile gets flatter and higher. This is not what we observe in the markets where the forward smile tends to be similar to the current smile.\n\nThis is because the initial smile you calibrate the model too has decreasing skew:\n$$\n\\partial_K \\Sigma(0,S;T,K) \\xrightarrow[T\\to +\\infty]{} 0\n$$ \n\n2. Smile rolling. In a LV model, smile tends to move in the opposite direction of the spot and get higher independently of the direction of the spot.\nThis is not consistent with what is observed on markets. See Hagan and al. Managing Smile Risk for the derivation. This means that\n$\\partial_S \\Sigma_{LV}(t,S;T,K)$ often has the wrong sign so your Delta will be wrong which can lead to a higher hedging error than using BS. \n3. Barrier options. In FX markets, barrier options like Double No Touch are liquid but a LV model calibrated to vanilla prices does not reproduce these prices. This is a consequence of the previous point.   \n\nThe LV model is a static model. Its whole dynamic comes from the volatility surface at time 0. But the vol surface has a dynamic that is richer than that.\nThere are alternatives using multiple factors like SV models, LSV models (parametric local vol like SABR or fully non parametric local vol), models of the joint dynamic of the spot and vol surface etc... but the LV model remains the default model in many cases due to its simplicity, its ability to calibrate the initial smile perfectly and its numerical efficiency.

    "original_question": "In monopoly, can an opponent put a property up for auction at a higher price than I have in cash?",
    "response": "This is definitely allowed, and a good tactic to leverage a cash advantage.\nThere is no minimum or maximum price for an auction.  The rules state:\n\nBidding may start at any price.\n\nMonopoly auctions do not have &quot;the bidding will start at $10&quot;.  They just have &quot;bidding is open&quot;.  Once the auction begins, a bid by any player sets the minimum price for the auction at that bid.  Your opponent could easily bid $10 on the property, forcing you to either let them have it for $10 or bid more than you have in cash.  You could bid first, say starting the bid at $5, but that doesn't meaningfully change the situation, as they can just respond by out-bidding you at $10.\n\nYou may bid more money than you have in cash, but you are still obligated to pay it if you win the auction.  This may be a reasonable play if you can afford it by mortgaging property and/or selling houses, especially to drive up the price for your opponent.  But be careful not to bid  more than you can pay after mortgages and sales, as if you win the auction and can't pay your bid, you go bankrupt.  In particular, if you bid more than you can afford, you opponents can all just let you win the bid, at which point you go bankrupt and the property you just bought would go up for auction again (in addition to all your other properties).",

    "original_question": "What does ```class``` do in Ruby?",
    "response": "First, the ```class``` syntax opens up ```foo```'s singleton class (eigenclass). This allows you to specialise the behaviour of methods called on that specific object.\n```a = 'foo'\nclass << a\n  def inspect\n    '\"bar\"'\n  end\nend\na.inspect   # => \"bar\"\na = 'foo'   # new object, new singleton class\na.inspect   # => \"foo\"\n```\n\nNow, to answer the question: ```class``` opens up ```self```'s singleton class, so that methods can be redefined for the current ```self``` object (which inside a class or module body is the class or module itself). Usually, this is used to define class/module (\"static\") methods:\n```class String\n  class << self\n    def value_of obj\n      obj.to_s\n    end\n  end\nend\nString.value_of 42   # => \"42\"\n```\nThis can also be written as a shorthand:\n```class String\n  def self.value_of obj\n    obj.to_s\n  end\nend\n```\nOr even shorter:\n```def String.value_of obj\n  obj.to_s\nend\n```\n\nWhen inside a function definition, ```self``` refers to the object the function is being called with. In this case, ```class``` opens the singleton class for that object; one use of that is to implement a poor man's state machine:\n```class StateMachineExample\n  def process obj\n    process_hook obj\n  end\nprivate\n  def process_state_1 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_2\n    end\n  end\n  def process_state_2 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_1\n    end\n  end\n  # Set up initial state\n  alias process_hook process_state_1\nend\n```\nSo, in the example above, each instance of ```StateMachineExample``` has ```process_hook``` aliased to ```process_state_1```, but note how in the latter, it can redefine ```process_hook``` (for ```self``` only, not affecting other ```StateMachineExample``` instances) to ```process_state_2```. So, each time a caller calls the ```process``` method (which calls the redefinable ```process_hook```), the behaviour changes depending on what state it's in.",

    "response": "The ```\\leavevmode``` is defined by LaTeX and plainTeX and ensures that the vertical mode is ended and horizontal mode is entered. In vertical mode, TeX stacks horizontal boxes vertically, whereas in horizontal mode, they are taken as part of the text line.\nFor example ```\\mbox{..}``` is defined as ```\\leavevmode\\hbox{..}``` to ensure that horizontal mode is entered if it is used at the beginning of a paragraph. If you only use ```\\hbox{ }``` it is stacked above the following paragraph instead.\nCompare:\n```Text\\par\\hbox{Hello} World\n```\nResult:\n```  Text\nHello\n  World\n```\nwith:\n```Text\\par\\mbox{Hello} World\n```\nResult:\n```  Text\n  Hello World\n```\nYou see that in the first case the ```\\hbox``` is stacked with the two paragraphs vertically (but without paragraph indention) because it is processed in vertical mode. In the second case horizontal mode is entered first and so ```Hello``` is processed as part of the second paragraph.\n\n  Use ```\\leavevmode``` for all macros which could be used at the begin of the paragraph and add horizontal boxes by themselves (e.g. in form of text).\n\nFor further reading about ```\\leavevmode``` please see \"The TeXBook\" by Donald E.

In order to earn my place in college as well, please provide me with steps I can take to earn cool points and change who I am slightly for the better in college.",
    "original_question": "How to be cool in college?",
    "response": "Congratulations, you’re in college! If you feel anxious at all about college life, know that you are not alone. To gain instant respect from your fellow classmates and friends, remember to always be yourself. Being friendly and acting confidently are also ways you can earn some cool points among your friends and classmates.\n\n## Reinvent yourself in college\n\n1. List the things you want to change about yourself. Grab a sheet of paper and draw a line down the middle. List the things that you would like to change about yourself in the left column. In the right column write down why you would like to change these things. If after asking why you see that making these changes leads to a better you, then change it. For example, wanting to be less critical of others, or more focused in class are positive changes.\n2. Try something new. College is all about exploring new things and ideas, so be adventurous. When you get the invite to go eat at an exotic restaurant, take it. Studying abroad for one year is another great way to expand your horizons. Try changing your hair color, or style your hair differently. You could also learn a new language, or take a class outside of your major.\n3. Remember to be yourself. It is possible to re-invent yourself without changing your true self. Don't throw out your morals and values just to be considered cool. If the change takes too much effort or requires you to be someone else, then it probably isn't a good change. Stick to changes that produce positive results. If you want to be more outgoing, then be more outgoing on your own terms. Don't start drinking or smoking just to be more outgoing, for example.\n\n\n## Boost your confidence\n\n1. Make a list of your strengths. Also make a list of the things that you like about yourself. Tape the list to your bedroom wall or bathroom mirror. Every morning, read the list to remind yourself of how great you are.\n2. Reverse negative thoughts. If you find yourself thinking that you aren't good enough for college or that no one will want to be friends with you, then reverse these thoughts. Instead, tell yourself, \"I am good enough for college,\" or \"Many people would love to be friends with me because I am a great friend.\"\n3. Do the things that make you feel confident. If wearing makeup helps you feel more confident, then wear makeup. If smiling and greeting your classmates makes you feel more confident, then greet them. If joining a club or volunteering helps you feel more confident, then join a club or volunteer. By doing the things that help you feel more confident, you will be more confident.\n4. Realize that you are not alone. New people and places can make you feel alone and unsure at times. However, understand that you aren't the only one who feels this way. Try to reach out and befriend other classmates, or call your high school friends if you need someone to talk to. If you cannot seem to shake your loneliness, make an appointment with a counselor on campus. A counselor can help you work through hard times.\n\n\n## Be social\n\n1. Portray a friendly attitude. Smile and say hi to your classmates sitting next you. Strike up a conversation by asking them what their major is or what they think about the class. Offering help, like showing someone where the admissions office is, is also a great way to become known as a friendly, down-to-earth person in college. You could also offer to trade notes with someone, or help someone study for a big test.\n2. Be accepting those who are different from you. A typical college has at least 20,000 students, (smaller colleges and community colleges might have anywhere from 2,000-10,000 students) so you are bound to run into someone whose background is completely different from yours. Instead of shying away from them, be curious about who they are. Invite them to lunch or a party to get to know them better.\n3. Attend a football game (or any other sporting event). Tailgating with friends and attending a football game (or any other sporting event) afterward is a college pastime you won’t want to pass up. Go to as many of these as you can, especially if you enjoy them. It is a great way to connect with new people and cultivate friendships. Ask a classmate if they would like to go to a game, or make plans with your roommate to attend a game.\n4. Join a club on campus. If football games or Greek life isn’t your thing, try looking into different clubs on campus. Like sororities and fraternities, they typically host events in the beginning of the year to recruit new members. Attend some of these and join your favorite ones. There are so many clubs in college, the hardest part will be picking one. You can also start a club as well.\n5. Host a party. Hosting a party will definitely shoot you up to the top of the cool list. Have a potluck, plan an outdoor party at a nearby park, or reserve a party room at your college’s game center. Invite your friends, roommates, and acquaintances from class. You could also have a small party in your dorm room, if it is allowed. To ensure your party’s success, make sure to provide some snacks and beverages, cool tunes, and games.\n\n\n## Dress for college\n\n1. Put yourself together before class. Before going to class, make sure to brush your teeth and comb your hair. Also shower if you need to. By taking the time to groom yourself before class, you can give your classmates and professors a good impression of yourself.\n2. Choose sneakers over heels. Going from class to class requires a lot of walking. By wearing sneakers, you can ensure that your feet will be as comfortable as possible. . Some classes will require you to wear certain footwear for practical or safety reasons, especially if you are in some hands-on classes or a PE class. Your instructor/professor will inform you in the syllabus.\n3. Carry a jacket with you. Unlike high school, colleges usually don't have locker areas so you will be wearing or carrying a jacket during the winter season in colder climates. Classroom temperatures typically run very cold to sometimes very hot. Since it is hard to concentrate in class if you are cold, make sure to bring a jacket or a sweater with you. This way you can ensure that you will be comfortable and attentive in class.. People will be paying more attention to your outerwear as part of your look in college than in high school; so, make sure the outerwear you choose matches your preferred look.\n4. Dress with style. Arrive to class in an outfit that makes you feel comfortable, but also one that sends a message of sophistication and style. If casual athletic gear is your style, then wear that. If a cute dress or skirt makes you feel confident, then wear it.\n",

Há exatamente zero diferença no tratamento de ambas. Elas podem fazer as mesmas coisas, e todos os membros estão disponíveis em qualquer um deles, afinal assim se comporta um alias.\nDiferenças úteis na utilização e escolha:\n\n* ```string``` é apenas uma forma mais simples de usar o tipo ```String``` no C#, ou seja, ```string``` é a forma de &quot;tipar&quot; uma cadeia de caracteres no C# e ```String``` é um tipo do CLR. No C#, dependendo do contexto, é melhor usar uma ou outra forma. O tipo ```String``` presente no namespace ```System``` pode ser usado em qualquer linguagem que se utilize do CLR.\n\n* ```string``` não pode ser usado com reflexão. ```String``` deve ser usado no lugar.\n\n* ```String``` pode ser usado para criar outros aliases:\n``` using str = System.String;\n //...\n str s = &quot;Foi usado outro alias para string.&quot;;\n // a variável 's' é do tipo System.String que é o mesmo que ser string\n```\nMas esse é apenas um exemplo, não há necessidade e não é recomendado usar em código real. Existe sim casos que um alias pode ser útil, mas esse apenas dificulta a leitura para quem não está acostumado com isso, sem trazer nenhum benefício.\n\n* Há alguns locais que ocorre o oposto e criar um alias pode trazer mais legibilidade ao código.\n\n* Em outros casos pode ser apenas estranho usar um ou outro e dificultar a leitura.\n\n* Na verdade o tipo ```String``` deve ser usado como ```System.String``` ou onde exista um ```using System```, enquanto que ```string``` pode ser usado em qualquer código que o compilador já entenderá.\n\n* ```String``` pode ser usado como identificador válido. ```string``` é uma palavra reservada e não pode ser um identificador.\n\n* Há uma diferença na forma como o syntax highlight apresenta ambos. Pois uma forma é tipo e a outra é palavra chave.\n\n* Apesar da recomendação geral em usar ```string``` sempre que possível enquanto está programando em C#, há controvérsias no seu uso. Alguns alegam que ```String``` é preferencial para deixar claro, através do Pascal Case, que você está usando um tipo de referência(en).\nMas não faz muito sentido porque ```Int32``` é tipo de valor(en) e também usa PascalCase (ou lowerCamelCase). E ainda ele, apesar de ser tipo de referência, tem semântica de valor. Então mesmo que usasse a lógica de Pascal Case para tipo de referência, e Camel Case (ou (UpperCamelCase) para tipo de valor, pela semântica, que é o que importa, ele deveria ser Camel Case, ou seja, deveria começar com minúsculo mesmo.\nNo CLR o estilo de case é usado para ajudar determinar outras características do identificador.\n\n* É possível substituir o tipo oficial por outro seu com mesmo nome se fizer tudo corretamente. O *alias *apontará para esse novo tipo que tem o mesmo nome e é colocado da mesma forma. Se ele não for exatamente o mesmo nome (incluindo o namespace) aí ele só pode ser usado opcionalmente o que quase inviabiliza o uso real.\n\n\nImportante lembrar que ele é um tipo como outro qualquer por referência com semântica por valor e algumas facilidades que o compilador dá. O mesmo vale se usar ```String```.\nTambém vale lembrar que não existe tipo primitivo em C# (outra referência). Isso existe só como conceito do CLR, mesmo assim não como algo fundamental.\nImportante notar que tudo isso é válido para o C#, outras linguagens como Java, ou até mesmo VB.NET podem ter mais diferenças.\n\n* Documentação oficial do ```string``` dizendo que é um alias.\n* FAQ reafirmando sobre aliases de tipos.\n* ```System.String```.\n\nColoquei no GitHub para referência futura.",

    "original_question": "How to eat to slow down bone loss in menopause?",
    "response": "Your bones reach their peak bone mass level when you are in your 30s, and then bone mass starts to decline. For women approaching menopause, bone loss is an even bigger concern because bone cell regeneration begins to slow around this time. However, there are steps that you can take to prevent bone loss, including avoiding certain foods, eating calcium-rich foods, and taking other preventative measures like exercising and having a bone mineral density test. Learn how to eat to get the right blend of vitamins and minerals and reduce your chances of losing bone mass as you age.\n\n## Reduce bone loss with food choices\n\n1. Steer clear of soft drinks. Many carbonated beverages contain phosphoric acid, which can affect your body’s ability to absorb calcium. Phosphoric acid causes you to lose calcium when you urinate. To reduce the calcium that you lose from drinking sodas, limit or avoid sodas altogether. Try drinking beverages that do not contain phosphoric acid, such as club soda, water, herbal teas, black or green teas, or fortified orange juice.\n2. Watch your sodium intake. Sodium is a major cause of calcium loss and a high-sodium diet has been linked with developing osteoporosis. The more sodium you have in your diet, the more calcium you will need to get in order to make up for it. Try to limit your sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day to help reduce your calcium loss.\n3. Limit caffeine. Caffeine also reduces your body’s ability to absorb calcium, so it is important to keep your caffeine intake under control to prevent low calcium levels. If you want to eliminate bone loss from caffeine intake, you can switch to decaf or choose beverages that are naturally caffeine free, such as peppermint or chamomile tea. Try not to exceed 300 milligrams of caffeine per day. That’s about the equivalent of 2 8 fl oz (240 mL) cups of coffee. Try switching to tea. It is lower in caffeine than coffee and has been shown to protect bones from calcium loss.\n4. Cook from scratch whenever possible. Food that is processed lacks trace minerals that have a protective effect on bones. To make sure that you are getting the most nutrient-dense diet possible, cook your meals from scratch whenever you can. Try choosing fresh instead of frozen or canned vegetables, make your own bread, cook whole grains such as brown rice, and avoid pre-packaged prepared foods.\n5. Choose quality proteins. Since bones are made up of mostly protein, getting enough of the right kind of protein is an important part of maintaining bone density. Try to avoid red meat as much as possible since it tends to be more acidic and may reduce the amount of calcium that your body can absorb. Make sure that you include enough quality protein sources for your size and gender to reduce bone loss. Good sources of protein include:\n\t* Eggs\n\t* Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt\n\t* Poultry, such as chicken and turkey\n\t* Seafood, such as salmon, halibut, and shrimp\n6. Skip the soy unless your doctor recommends it. Soy has been found to have adverse effects on the absorption of calcium as well, so it is best to avoid eating too much soy. Even if a soy product is fortified with calcium, your body won’t absorb the calcium well. If you rely on soy as a primary source of protein, then it is a good idea to take a calcium supplement for extra protection. On the other hand, some studies have shown that eating soy-based foods may improve bone health overall and reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian about whether you should incorporate soy into your diet.\n7. Eat sources of Vitamin K. There are 2 forms of vitamin K: K1(phylloquinone) and K2 (menaquinone). The combination is sometimes called MK7 in commercial supplement products. You should aim for about 250-1000 mcg of K1 and 45-180 mcg of K2 per day. Eat a good source of vitamin K 2 to 3 times a week to get these amounts or take a supplement. Natural food sources of vitamin K include:\n\t* Sauerkraut\n\t* Aged cheese\n\t* Natto (a soy product)\n\t* Kimchee (fermented Korean cabbage)\n\t* Beef liver\n\t* Green tea\n\t* Turnip greens\n\t* Broccoli\n\t* Kale\n\t* Spinach\n\t* Cabbage\n\t* Asparagus\n\t* Dark green lettuce\n\n\n## Get more calcium\n\n1. Drink and eat low-fat dairy products. Dairy products provide a significant amount of calcium, so make sure that you include 2 to 3 servings of dairy per day in order to get enough calcium. Since dairy products are naturally high in fat, it is a good idea to seek out low-fat and fat free dairy products. Milk has long been known as a good source of calcium and it should be a staple in your diet if you are trying to avoid bone loss. Drink 2 to 3 glasses of low-fat or non-fat milk per day. Cheese and yogurt are also good sources calcium, although they do not contain as much calcium as milk does. Choose low-fat cheese and yogurt to reduce your intake of unhealthy fats.\n2. Include canned sardines and salmon in your diet. Certain canned fish, such as sardines and salmon, are also good sources of calcium, as long as you eat the bones. The fish bones tend to be softer in canned fish, so they are edible. When eaten fresh, certain types of fish are good sources of vitamin D as well. For example, salmon, tuna, and mackerel are good sources of vitamin D.\n3. Have some leafy greens. Leafy greens such as kale, Chinese cabbage, turnip greens, and collard greens are also good sources of calcium. Try sautéing some greens, adding them to a soup, or using them in place of your usual salad greens.\n4. Choose calcium-fortified orange juice. Drinking orange juice that has been fortified with calcium may also help you to prevent bone loss. Choose fortified orange juice as well as other types of fortified beverages to get a little more calcium in your diet.\n5. Take a supplement that contains calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. To ensure that you are getting enough calcium in your diet every day, take a supplement that contains calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. To help prevent bone loss, it is crucial to get enough magnesium and vitamin D along with calcium. It may be easier for your body to absorb calcium if you take it in smaller doses with meals (500 mg at a time). However, it is possible to get too much calcium, so talk to your doctor about the best amount and type of calcium supplement for you.\n\n\n## Take other step\n\n1. Get regular exercise. Performing regular weight-bearing exercise is a good way to build bone mass and prevent bone loss as well. Weight-bearing exercises include walking, dancing, jogging, and dancing. Non-weight bearing exercises include biking and swimming. Try going for a 30-minute walk most days of the week to get in some weigh-bearing exercise and help prevent bone loss.\n2. Spend time in the sun. The best way to get your daily dose of vitamin D is to spend about 15–20 minutes in the sun without sunblock every day. Exposure to the sun allows your body to produce its own vitamin D. Since this may not always be possible, especially during the winter in some places, supplementing with vitamin D is still advised.\n3. Get tested for osteoporosis. One serious problem with osteoporosis is that it can be symptomless. Many women will not know that they have osteoporosis until after a bone fracture. That is why it is a good idea to have a bone mineral density (BMD) test if you are at risk of osteoporosis. This test is often called a DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and can help your healthcare professional to diagnose osteoporosis. Women over the age of 65 are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis, but other women under the age of 65 may be affected as well. Ask your doctor about getting a DEXA scan if you have:\n\t* Broken a bone from doing something that should not have caused a broken bone, like falling from a standing position\n\t* A chronic condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, or an eating disorder\n\t* Early onset menopause\n\t* Undergone hormone treatments, such as for prostate or breast cancer\n\t* Lost a noticeable amount of height\n\t* A history of smoking or currently smoke\n\t* Family members who have had osteoporosis\n\t* Been taking certain medications, such as corticosteroid or thyroid hormone replacement medications\n\t* A tendency to drink 3 or more alcoholic beverages most days\n4. Learn your T-score and Z-score. The results of a DEXA scan are known as a “T-score” and a “Z-score,” though for most people, the T-score is most important. In both the T-scores and the Z-scores, a negative number indicates that your bones are thinner or more porous than they should be. A higher negative number means that you have a higher risk of a bone fracture. If your T-score is between 0 and -1.0, this is considered normal. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 indicates that you have early osteoporosis, known as osteopenia. A T-score of less than -2.5 indicates osteoporosis.\n\n\n## When to seek medical treatment\n\n1. See your doctor if you have symptoms of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis doesn’t always have symptoms, especially in its early stages. However, there are some signs and symptoms you can look out for if you’re going through menopause or have other risk factors for osteoporosis. Call your doctor right away if:You’ve recently fractured a bone, especially if the fracture happened more easily than expected\n\t* You are experiencing frequent back pain\n\t* You notice your posture becoming stooped\n\t* You’re not as tall as you used to be\n2. Ask your doctor about medical treatment or prevention options. Diet and lifestyle changes can help prevent or slow bone loss associated with menopause, but there are also medical options. If you’re going through menopause and are at risk of developing osteoporosis, your doctor may recommend taking hormone therapy, vitamin D supplements, or osteoporosis medications. Common osteoporosis medications include:Bisphosphonates, a type of medication that prevents bone loss\n\t* Injected medications that can prevent bone loss and even stimulate new bone growth, such as denosumab (Prolia) and teriparatide (Forteo)\n3. Talk to your doctor before making major diet or lifestyle changes. Your individual diet and exercise needs depend on a lot of factors, including your age, weight, and overall health. Before drastically changing your diet or starting a new exercise regimen, talk to your doctor about what’s safe and healthy for you. For example, if you already have osteoporosis or a related condition, such as osteoarthritis, your doctor may advise avoiding certain types of exercise. Talk to them about doing forms of exercise that are easy on your bones and joints, such as low-impact aerobics, swimming, biking, or fast walking. Always let your doctor know before you take any dietary supplements, since these could interfere with medications or supplements you are already taking, or affect any medical conditions you might have.\n",

    "original_question": "I am used to thinking of finite-differences as a special case of finite-elements, on a very constrained grid. What are criteria to choose between finite-differences and finite-elements",
    "response": "It is possible to write most specific finite difference methods as Petrov-Galerkin finite element methods with some choice of local reconstruction and quadrature, and most finite element methods can also be shown to be algebraically equivalent to some finite difference method. Therefore, we should choose a method based on which analysis framework we want to use, which terminology we like, which system for extensibility we like, and how we would like to structure software. The following generalizations hold true in the vast majority of variations in practical use, but many points can be circumvented.\nFinite Difference\nPros\n\n* efficient quadrature-free implementation\n* aspect ratio independence and local conservation for certain schemes (e.g. MAC for incompressible flow)\n* robust nonlinear methods for transport (e.g. ENO/WENO)\n* M-matrix for some problems\n* discrete maximum principle for some problems (e.g. mimetic finite differences)\n* diagonal (usually identity) mass matrix\n* inexpensive nodal residual permits efficient nonlinear multigrid (FAS)\n* cell-wise Vanka smoothers give efficient matrix-free smoothers for incompressible flow\n\nCons\n\n* more difficult to implement \"physics\"\n* staggered grids are sometimes quite technical\n* higher than second order on unstructured grids is difficult\n* no Galerkin orthogonality, so convergence may be more difficult to prove\n* not a Galerkin method, so discretization and adjoints do not commute (relevant to optimization and inverse problems)\n* self-adjoint continuum problems often yield non-symmetric matrices\n* solution is only defined pointwise, so reconstruction at arbitrary locations is not uniquely defined\n* boundary conditions tend to be complicated to implement\n* discontinuous coefficients usually make the methods first order\n* stencil grows if physics includes \"cross terms\"\n\nFinite Element\nPros\n\n* Galerkin orthogonality (discrete solution to coercive problems is within a constant of the best solution in the space)\n* simple geometric flexibility\n* discontinuous Galerkin offers robust transport algorithm, arbitrary order on unstructured grids\n* cellwise entropy inequality guaranteeing $L^2$ stability holds independent of mesh, dimension, order of accuracy, and presence of discontinuous solutions, without needing nonlinear limiters\n* easy of implementing boundary conditions\n* can choose conservation statement by choosing test space\n* discretization and adjoints commute (for Galerkin methods)\n* elegant foundation in functional analysis\n* at high order, local kernels can exploit tensor product structure that is missing with FD\n* Lobatto quadrature can make methods energy-conserving (assuming a symplectic time integrator)\n* high order accuracy even with discontinuous coefficients, as long as you can align to boundaries\n* discontinuous coefficients inside elements can be accommodated with XFEM\n* easy to handle multiple inf-sup conditions\n\nCons\n\n* many elements have trouble at high aspect ratio\n* continuous FEM has trouble with transport (SUPG is diffusive and oscillatory)\n* DG usually has more degrees of freedom for same accuracy (though HDG is much better)\n* continuous FEM does not provide cheap nodal problems, so nonlinear smoothers have much poorer constants\n* usually more nonzeros in assembled matrices\n* have to choose between consistent mass matrix (some nice properties, but has full inverse, thus requiring an implicit solve per time step) and lumped mass matrix.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "How can I know how someone feels about me? \nCan I decipher those of someone I know?",
    "original_question": "How to tell if it's an acquaintance, friend, crush, or love?",
    "response": "Feelings and emotions can be complex and difficult to understand, especially when trying to decipher those of someone you know.  Are you simply an acquaintance?  Do they consider you a friend?  Is it love or just a crush? There are many layers to relationships and it's not always clear where you stand with someone.  However, there are several different methods to decode how a person feels about you and perceives your relationship.\n\n## Read body language\n\n1. Notice the amount of eye contact. People’s eyes can be very expressive and tell a lot about how they’re feeling toward those around them. Friends will make eye contact with each other during conversation to show interest and respect. Someone with a crush on you will make repeated eye contact with you whether in a conversation or not. A crush may hold eye contact for a few seconds, and then look away from shyness, and find your gaze again later. Dilated pupils are another indication of a crush. Someone who’s in love with you will feel totally comfortable locking gazes for extended periods of time.\n2. Gauge proximity. The amount of space people choose to place between themselves and others can be an indicator of their perceived relationships with those around them. Someone who is your friend will stand or sit closer to you than an acquaintance. A person with a crush on you will stand near you, lean toward you, and look for reasons to get closer to you- whether it’s intentionally walking past you at a close range, or leaning in closer than necessary to talk to you. People who are in love will stand or sit very close together- perhaps their hips touch when standing side by side or their knees touch when sitting across from one another.\n3. Monitor movement. Our movements, whether conscious or unconscious, can convey lots of different meanings about how we feel about those around us. Friends will tilt their heads while in conversations with other friends to show that they’re listening. They may touch each other in light, casual ways on the hand or arm. Someone with a crush will look for reasons to touch the other person, often in a playful and flirty way. They may seem fidgety or nervous, and may subconsciously begin to copy the movements of their crush. Someone who is in love with you will seem very comfortable and secure around you. They may touch you using gentle, caressing gestures.\n4. Pay attention to posture. The way a person stands (or sits) when they're around you may give you some clues as to how they feel about you. A friend will stand with his or her shoulders and face pointing toward you. If sitting, he or she will uncross his or her legs to show that he or she is open to you. His or her palms may be open toward you as well, another sign of receptivity. When someone has a crush on you, they stand tall and slightly stick their chest out. Additionally, they will point their toes and hips toward you, as a sign of wanting to move toward you (both figuratively and literally).\n\n\n## Listen for verbal cue\n\n1. Recognize vocal tone. The inflection and quality of a person’s voice will change subconsciously depending on the feelings they have toward you. Listen to how someone talks in general, and compare it with they sound when talking to you individually. A friend’s voice will remain constant, with little to no change in pitch or tone. A crush’s voice will have a playful and flirtatious quality to it. Women use a higher pitch to accentuate their femininity. Men use a lower pitch, but alter the pitch, almost to a “sing-song” tone, to both highlight masculinity, and make a woman feel at ease. People who are in love will alter their voices to match their partners’. Men talk in a higher pitch and women a lower one to show that they are connected as one.\n2. Think about how casual your conversations are. A conversation between friends is usually casual and comfortable. Both you and your friend ask and answer questions equally, and may or may not make future plans to hang out.\n3. Notice how much they talk about themselves. If someone has a crush, they will talk a lot about themselves, both from nerves and as a way to “humble-brag.” They will also ask about you, and agree enthusiastically with what you say to make it seem like you have things in common.\n4. Analyze how intimate your conversations are. If someone is in love with you, they will open up to you in intimate ways. You may find out about their deep insecurities and fears, childhood, family dynamics, important personal values, and vision for the future. They may plan future vacations, or invite you to meet family.\n\n\n## Analyze your relationship\n\n1. Reflect on your relationship. Take some time in a quiet place simply to think about your feelings toward the person in question, and your interactions with them. Some questions to consider are:\n\t* How long have you known this person? How frequently do you see or talk to them? Is the communication equitable? What is the level of intimacy shared (either physically or conversationally)? How would you characterize your time together? Do you both seem to enjoy being together?\n2. Make a list. If you’re trying to determine whether someone is a friend or a crush, make a “Friend/Crush” list. If you’re figuring out whether someone is in love with you, make a “Like/Love” list. Like a Pro/Con list, record any specific behavior that would indicate how they feel about you. Having a visual aid way may give you more insight into how they feel.\n3. Ask a trusted friend for help. Sometimes our feelings toward someone can cloud our judgment in assessing their behavior. A friend can offer an honest, objective observation of the relationship, and will be less likely to allow personal feelings to affect their understanding.\n\n\n## Ask directly\n\n1. Express your feelings first. If you’re asking someone to open up to you, then you need to be upfront with them as well. If you’re looking for honesty, you need to show you’re capable of reciprocating. People are more likely to be direct with you if you’re direct with them. Start with a sentence like, \"I want you to know that I feel\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_about you/our relationship. I'm hoping you'll be just as honest and share your feelings about me.\"\n2. Ask in a tactful, non-threatening way. Explain that you’re simply trying to gain some insight and clarity in your relationship, and that you respect their feelings no matter what. It’s important for your partner to know that they can open up to you, without an abrasive reaction. Try saying something like, \"I want you to know that I will completely honor and respect your answer, even if it's not the one I want to hear.\"\n3. Be prepared for the consequences. There’s a chance you and your partner may be on two different wavelengths in terms of your relationship. Their answer may sting a little. Take some time to decide how you want to proceed in the relationship, knowing exactly how your partner feels about you.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "How can i flirt with coworkers of the opposite sex",
    "original_question": "How to flirt with a co worker (for women)?",
    "response": "Flirting with coworkers can relieve workplace tension and monotony. Some women flirt because they are interested in starting a romantic relationship with one of their coworkers. Others do it just for fun. Workplace flirting requires extra precautions because you must remain professional. You can still encourage some playful interaction between you and your coworker by engaging in friendly conversation, adjusting your body language, and dressing in a flirtatious but professional way.\n\n## Interact with your coworker\n\n1. Chat with them. Men tend to interpret friendly and talkative women as flirty. Find excuses to chat with them when they are not busy. Some things you can try:\n\t* Talk about hobbies, interests, and plans outside of work. \"Any big plans for the weekend? I've been dying to see this new movie myself.\" Praise their recent accomplishments or awards: \"I heard you just received an award! Any plans to celebrate?\" Ask them about current projects by saying, \"Hey, how is that current project going? Are you hanging in there?\"\n2. Laugh at their jokes. If your coworker makes a joke or says something even slightly funny, laugh. Laughing is a gentle way of flirting. It should not feel forced, nor should it seem as though you are laughing at your coworker.\n3. Compliment them. Appreciate the work that they do around the office, and praise them for their strengths. You want to make sure that you are appreciating their skills, abilities, and personality instead of their looks. Some good, flirty compliments include:\n\t* \"Great job on that last presentation. You'll have to give me some tips.\" \"Thanks for helping with that last project. You make my life so much easier around here.\" \"You have such good ideas. How do you come up with them?\" Be extremely careful with workplace compliments. If it seems as though the recipient is awkward or uncomfortable, stop immediately.\n4. Ask them for help. Asking people to help you can increase their self-esteem and confidence, which encourages them to flirt back with you. It also shows that you appreciate their strengths in a work-friendly manner. It can even encourage them to spend more time with you. Some ways you try this include:\n\t* \"Hey, you're good with technology, right? Can you help me with my computer?\" \"Do you mind listening to me practice my presentation? I'd love to get your feedback on this.\" \"Can you help me lock up tomorrow night?\"\n5. Hang out around their desk. Find excuses to drop by their desk. Perhaps you have a question about your project. Perhaps their desk is close to the coffee maker. As you pass by, make eye contact and ask them about their day. Walk by their desk, and try to catch their eye. If they look up at you, smile and ask, \"how's your day been?\" or \"Are you hanging in there?\" You can also ask, \"how is the work going? Do you want to take a coffee break?\" This gives them the opportunity to start a conversation if they are interested. Do not interrupt your coworker if they look as though they are busy with something else. Instead of being flirty, you might only annoy them.\n6. Invite them out to coffee or lunch. You may be feeling bolder, or you want to make the next step in your relationship. Instead of asking them to drinks or dinner, which can be too formal, try asking them if they would like to grab something to eat over your lunch break. Coffee is also a great way to bond with your coworker. A good way to ask is to just say, \"Hey, we should catch up over lunch. Do you want to grab a bite to eat somewhere?\"\n7. Respect their boundaries. Your first priority at work is to do your job. Be warned that flirting at work can get you in trouble if someone complains. If your coworker seems uncomfortable or asks you to stop, do not continue flirting with them. Give them space by only talking to them about work-related matters for a few weeks. Before you make any moves whatsoever, review your workplace sexual harassment rules, as well as rules about relationships in the workplace. You can also talk to someone in the HR department if you have any further questions. Make workplace friendly jokes that have no sexual innuendo. Never flirt with your boss. They are in a position of power, and any flirting can cause professional difficulties for both of you. It is best to flirt with coworkers on your pay grade. Do not flirt with a coworker who is married or in a relationship. Even if a married coworker enjoys your flirting, you are putting both of you in a difficult situation.\n\n\n## Express interest with body language\n\n1. Make eye contact. Eye contact is one of the primary tactics of flirtation. Brief glances can show your attraction and interest in another person. You can try looking across the room during a meeting or glancing across the table at lunch. Meet their eyes briefly before glancing down and away.\n2. Smile. Smiling is an open and friendly act that invites people to interact with you. In fact, smiling may be one of the best ways to meet new people and start new relationships. As your coworker passes your desk, glance up briefly and smile. If you catch their eye in a meeting, give them a quick grin. Don’t linger. A small smile is all it takes.\n3. Show off your neck. When you know they are looking at you, try to casually flip your hair to show off your neck. This shows the curve of your neck while drawing attention to your hair. This is a casual but flirty move that makes it seem as though you are not deliberately trying to catch their attention.\n4. Lean over their desk. Leaning or orienting yourself towards another person signals that you are interested in them. You can practice this while working on a project with your coworker. Lean over the desk to point out something. Reach out so that your arm is crossing their body without touching them. If you’re working on a shared computer, shift your body so that your feet and shoulders are tilted towards them.\n5. Avoid touching. While gently touching someone is often a form of flirting, it can get you in trouble in the workplace. Try to use body language that does not involve physical contact. If your touching is unwanted, you can get in trouble for harassment.\n\n\n## Increase your attractiveness\n\n1. Wear make-up. Many men find women who wear make-up more appealing. Men typically like to flirt more with women whom they find attractive, so making yourself more attractive is especially important if you want to flirt with a co-worker. Eye make-up in particular can increase your flirtatiousness.\n2. Put on heels. Heels can increase your attractiveness to men. The higher your heels, the more likely men are to approach you. High heels can push your pelvis and chest out, arch your backside, and make your legs look tighter and more muscular—all of which make you more attractive.\n3. Apply light perfume. Perfume can boost your sex appeal but only if it is used sparingly. Spray once on your wrists. Rub your wrists together before dabbing them on your neck. This will give you just enough perfume to attract someone without annoying your other colleagues.\n4. Maintain professional standards. While you should look appealing to your coworker, you must keep in mind that you have to look professional as well. Follow your workplace’s dress code. Avoid tight or short clothing that reveals too much skin. Instead, try to find clothes that fit your body’s shape without being too revealing. If you can, try using eye catching colors instead of revealing clothing. Wear jewelry to draw attention to your neck and arms. Make sure that your hair is brushed and styled in a way that both accentuates your features and provides minimal distraction to you while working.\n",

Shouldn't having a small number of trees decrease the overall prediction quality as there's a lower chance for all features or observations to be used in a decision? And doesn't the high tree count increase overfitting?",
    "original_question": "Can you explain why we need a large number of trees in random forest when the number of predictors is large?  How can we determine the optimal number of trees?",
    "response": "Random forest uses bagging (picking a sample of observations rather than all of them) and random subspace method (picking a sample of features rather than all of them, in other words - attribute bagging) to grow a tree. If the number of observations is large, but the number of trees is too small, then some observations will be predicted only once or even not at all. If the number of predictors is large but the number of trees is too small, then some features can (theoretically) be missed in all subspaces used. Both cases results in the decrease of random forest predictive power. But the last is a rather extreme case, since the selection of subspace is performed at each node.\n\nDuring classification the subspace dimensionality is $\\sqrt{p}$ (rather small, $p$ is the total number of predictors) by default, but a tree contains many nodes. During regression the subspace dimensionality is $p/3$ (large enough) by default, though a tree contains fewer nodes. So the optimal number of trees in a random forest depends on the number of predictors only in extreme cases. \n\nThe official page of the algorithm states that random forest does not overfit, and you can use as much trees as you want. But Mark R. Segal (April 14 2004. \"Machine Learning Benchmarks and Random Forest Regression.\" Center for Bioinformatics & Molecular Biostatistics) has found that it overfits for some noisy datasets. So to obtain optimal number you can try training random forest at a grid of ```ntree``` parameter (simple, but more CPU-consuming) or build one random forest with many trees with ```keep.inbag```, calculate out-of-bag (OOB) error rates for first $n$ trees (where $n$ changes from $1$ to ```ntree```) and plot OOB error rate vs. number of trees (more complex, but less CPU-consuming).",

    "original_question": "What is the difference between kerning vs. letter spacing?",
    "response": "Any font has built-in spacing determined by the “side bearing” of each character. In metal type, the side bearing is the physical right or left edge of the individual piece of type that determines its spacing from the characters on either side. Digital fonts mimic this in the basic design process.\n\n* “To kern” means to adjust the spacing between a pair of letters, numerals, punctuation, etc.  (properly “glyphs”) so that their spacing looks correct. The letters AV, for example, have to overlap in any usual typeface, otherwise at least one of them ends up looking lost and bewildered. Their kerning is tightened to snug them up to one another. An italic f will collide with a following question or quote mark in some fonts, so the kerning must be opened up from the default spacing.\n\nAn ancient scribe could kern effortlessly with pen and ink, and if you read old manuscripts you'll see lots of places where a letter intrudes into the space of the one next to it. With metal type, it wasn't so easy. Kerning required cutting away some of the metal base, or table, of the character. The amount of time, skill and work involved is left as an exercise for readers whose minds are in need of a little boggling. The shapes of the letters in metal type intended for long passages of text such as books, or especially newspapers, were designed to minimize the amount of kerning that would be necessary.\n\nKerning tables built into a digital font assign preset kerning values to specific letter pairs, according to the designer's best estimate of how they should look. There can be a dozen or so pairs (or none!) in a cheapo font, thousands in a high-end one. No matter how thoroughly and well a kerning table is built, though, there will still be situations where some awkward combination requires that the kerning be loosened or tightened from the preset values of the glyphs.\n\n* Letter spacing (often “tracking” in software applications) adjusts the spacing between all the glyphs in a piece of text. This can help to make a page look a little more open and inviting, for example, especially with a similarly open leading. Very large type, such as a big headline, almost always benefits from tightening the tracking. Tiny type, such as in captions or footnotes, is made more readable by opening the letter spacing a bit, especially if the paper is absorbent and will allow the ink to spread a little.\n\nA final note: Use caution with both kerning and tracking. Tracking is very often wildly overdone, kerning is seldom done enough.",

    "original_question": "Best way to start investing, for a young person just starting their career?",
    "response": "First off, I highly recommend the book Get a Financial Life. The basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward, and this book does a great job with it. It is very light reading, and it really geared for the young person starting their career. \n\nNow, with that out of the way, there's really two kinds of \"investing\" to think about:\n\n1. Retirement (401k, IRA, SIMPLE, etc)\n2. Non-Retirement (Brokerage account, investing in individual stocks, day trading, etc)\n\nFor most individuals, it is best to take care of #1 first. Most people shouldn't even think about #2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts, established an emergency fund, and gotten their debt under control.\n\nThere are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing, both from your employer, and the government. All the more reason to take care of #1 before #2!\n\nYour employer probably offers some kind of 401k (or equivalent, like a 403b) with a company-provided match. This is a potential 100% return on your investment after the vesting period. No investment you make on your own will ever match that. Additionally, there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k. (The money you contribute doesn't count as taxable income.)\n\n***The best way to start investing is to learn about your employer's retirement plan, and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching.***\n\nBeyond this, there are also Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you can open to contribute money to on your own. You should open one of these and start contributing, but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k. The IRA won't give you that 100% ROI that the 401k will.\n\nKeep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much \"walled off\" from your day-to-day financial life. Money that goes into a retirement account generally can't be touched until retirement age, unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties. You generally don't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account.\n\nOne other thing to note: Your 401K and your IRA is an account that you put money into. Just because the money is sitting in the account doesn't necessarily mean it is invested. You put the money into this account, and then you use this money for investments. How you invest the retirement money is a topic unto itself. Here is a good starting point.",

    "original_question": "How to deal with a job loss?",
    "response": "Losing your job can take a toll on your well-being, finances, and self-worth. When dealing with a job loss, work through the stress by finding healthy and productive outlets. Address your finances and make necessary changes to budgeting and spending. Developing healthy habits can help you feel better and get you closer to re-entering the job market. While dealing with a job loss can be difficult, you can have a positive experience during your transition and even enjoy some of the changes you make.\n\n## Cop with stress from lose your job\n\n1. Allow yourself to experience grief. Losing a job is much more than losing your source of income. Your job may be a source of your identity and bring you personal and professional fulfillment. It’s normal to experience grief, so allow yourself to feel it. Accept whatever feelings come and know that they will not last forever. Pushing your emotions down or pretending they don’t exist will likely result in them coming up at another time, whether you like it or not. So, when you feel anger, sadness, hopelessness, or grief, let it be and don’t push it away.\n2. Use effective coping strategies. Dealing with a job loss will undeniably lead to stress. Cope with your stress by engaging in activities that make you feel good and relieve your stress in a healthy way. Find an activity that relaxes you and helps you feel calm. Engage in relaxing activities such as yoga, meditation, or journaling. Avoid using alcohol, drugs, or other harmful substances as a way to cope.\n3. Ask for emotional support from loved ones. While your loved ones can’t solve your problems, they can support you and lend a listening ear while you sort out your life. Find someone you trust and talk about your struggles and ask for support. You don’t need to go through your problems alone. Keeping your job loss a secret can make things worse. Know that there are people you can talk to and who will support you.\n4. Focus on what you can control. You can’t control your job loss or when you will get a new job. You won’t know when an employer will call you back or how many interviews you will get. Instead of focusing on things outside of your control, focus on what you can control, such as getting training, taking care of yourself, and surrounding yourself with positive influences. Think of what is within your control when you feel overwhelmed or stressed out.\n5. Find joy through a hobby or activity. If you don’t know what to do with yourself and the time you have, find activities that feel fulfilling. Try volunteering at an animal shelter or after-school program for children. Pick up a hobby that’s fun and fulfilling such as painting, dancing, woodworking, or traveling. Losing your job can make you feel like your sense of meaning is gone. Finding an enjoyable activity can help you experience some joy and fulfillment outside of work.\n\n\n## Handle financial matter\n\n1. Apply for financial assistance. Depending on where you live, you may be able to access government assistance when you become unemployed. Go to your local employment services department in your state or territory to see if you qualify for workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, medical assistance and insurance, financial assistance for food, and other benefits that can help in this difficult time. You can usually walk in and talk to someone the same day. Bring documents from your previous employer that outline your pay, insurance, benefits, etc. Assistance services can take time to get started, so apply for them as soon as you lose your job.\n2. Maintain a budget. If you’re not already using a budget, now is the perfect time to create one. Your goal for a budget while unemployed is to save money and reduce your overall expenses. Create categories for your spending such as food, car, rent/mortgage, pet care, or anything else that’s pertinent. Allocate money to each category and stay within the limit you set! Creating a budget will help you prioritize where your money goes and how much you will spend on different items. For example, set up a $200 budget each month for food and start buying foods that are healthy and will fill you up. Skip the restaurants and fancy foods and focus on getting your basic needs met.\n3. Save money. Your goal right now is to have enough money to get by and not worry about finances while you look for your next job. Cut back on extra expenses by making small changes, such as choosing a cheaper mobile phone plan or cancelling your gym membership if you’ve stopped going. Look for small things you can cut out that won’t affect you too much. For example, use generic products instead of branded items. Avoid buying books or movies. Instead, visit your local library to borrow them. Your library may even have other items available for loan, depending on how well-supported the library system is in your area.\n4. Stop unnecessary purchases. Losing a job often means a drastic cut in income or no source of income at all. Cut back on any unnecessary spending. For example, if you subscribe to a monthly magazine or promotional box, cancel it. If you eat out for most meals, consider cooking at home. These are simple ways to cut spending that can help you with financial stability. Find ways that you can cut spending without having to make drastic changes. For example, limit your online shopping. Make a list of your monthly expenses and determine if there are some you can eliminate or decrease. For example, some cable companies will allow you to decrease your monthly plan to a very basic plan for a lot less money for up to 6 months at a time.\n5. Make some extra money. If you’re struggling to make ends meet, there are some easy ways to make money quickly. Look around and find items in your home that you’re willing to part with in order to make some money. This might include clothes, electronics, books, or jewelry. If you have a spare bedroom in your home, consider renting it out to someone. Sign up with a rideshare company and offer rides locally when you have time. Look at freelancing job sites online. Some, such as Upwork, Guru, and Remote have a lot of different types of work that people are willing to pay you to do. While making some extra money takes some effort, it can pay off and make you feel more comfortable while you’re unemployed.\n\n\n## Keep a healthy lifestyle\n\n1. Keep a daily routine. Not having a job can mean that days feel like they stretch on forever or that you waste time only to realize that the day is over. Create a daily schedule or routine that helps you accomplish your goals and stay productive. Have a set time that you start and end your day so that you keep a general routine. For example, wake up at the same time each morning and keep a regular morning routine. Go to the gym, then start your job search. It might help to get out of the house when you do work.\n2. Get good sleep. Sleep often suffers when under stress, so keep good sleeping habits while dealing with your job loss. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on the weekends. Keep electronics out of your bedroom so the light does not disrupt your sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, try a relaxation routine before bedtime. For example, take a bath, drink a soothing herbal tea, or journal as a way to relax and ready yourself for sleep.\n3. Eat healthy foods. The food you put in your body may be easily overlooked, but it’s especially important to healthfully fuel yourself when dealing with the stress of job loss. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains such as brown rice and oats. Eat high-quality protein sources such as tempeh. Avoid foods that influence your mood, which might include sugar, caffeine, and high levels of preservatives or hormones. If you struggle with anxiety, stay away from nicotine and caffeine, which can increase anxiety.\n4. Talk with a counselor. A counselor can provide guidance and support while you are dealing with your job loss. For example, if you’re struggling with how to move forward or handle your stress, see a therapist to help. If you need help in gaining some direction with your career, consider seeing a career counselor. Find a counselor by calling your insurance provider or the employment center near you. You could also try talking to a career counselor. Career counselors can help you determine if the career you have is the right fit for you. Perhaps this is an opportunity to try something else.\n\n\n## Take step forward for your career\n\n1. Decide how you want to move forward. Losing your job might be a new beginning. Decide whether you want to continue in your career path or make some changes. You might want to take your career in a different direction or go back to school. Now is your chance for a new beginning should you want it. Knowing what you want can help you apply for jobs or get training that you need for a different position.\n2. Treat finding a job as a job. Make finding employment your full-time job. This can help you stay motivated and on task while between jobs. Break up your day as you would at your last job so that you have tasks to complete, deadlines to meet, and different activities to do. For example, spend time looking through job listings, making phone calls, and writing emails. Then, spend your afternoon revising your resume, doing some reading or completing training. Devote your time to finding your next job and get serious about it. Start by researching the jobs and companies you are interested in working for. Then create separate resumes for each type of job you would like. Use recruiting companies. There are many recruiters looking for people to fill jobs of all kinds all over the world, and they have access to job databases that the general public cannot access. Some companies even hire exclusively through recruiters. By sending your resume to recruiters and following up with them regularly, you can increase your chances of being considered for jobs you may not be aware of.\n3. Build your marketable skills. Take classes that can help you improve your business skills. Look for classes at your local employment center, park district, or on the internet. Gaining knowledge and skills that employers want can help you get a leg up once you submit your resume. Getting training can also show that you are current in your skills. Look for training that offers certificates, certifications, or other credentials that you can add to your resume for proof that you completed them. EdX is a great source for free online classes, and they offer certificates and credits. Visit https://www.edx.org/.\n4. Network with others in your field. Attend events, conferences, and lunches where you can meet other professionals and employers. Attend meetups geared toward professionals in your field. Look up job fairs and attend ones that interest you. The more connections you have, the better your odds of finding the job you want.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "How do I travel with kids and keep costs down?",
    "original_question": "How to save money when traveling with kids?",
    "response": "Traveling with kids can be a fun and exciting for the whole family. It can also be expensive, especially if you want to travel overseas or across the country. Between transportation, accommodations, and excursions, you may worry how you will be able to afford to travel with kids and ensure everyone has a good time. To save money when travelling with kids, focus on cheaper transportation options and affordable accommodations. You can also plan excursions and activities that will be affordable and fun for all.\n\n## Choose cheaper transportation options\n\n1. Drive rather than fly. To save money on transportation costs, consider planning an old fashioned road trip with the kids. The price of gas will likely be cheaper than paying for multiple plane tickets, especially if you have a large family. Try to travel with at least two people who can drive so you can drive in shifts, especially if the drive will be long. To keep the peace in the backseat while on the road trip, make sure you bring lots of snacks and games for the kids. Keep them occupied with music and singalongs in the car. This way, you can all travel in peace, cheaply.\n2. Use points to book cheaper flights. If you do want to fly to your destination as a family, be sure to use any points or reward miles that you have accumulated to book your plane tickets. Set up a rewards system for air travel through your credit card or through a rewards card for a specific airline. Always check to see if you can use points to reduce the cost of plane tickets or to get better deals on flights. You should also do your research on possible flight options so you can find the cheapest one. Compare flight prices online. Watch for flight deals and book them right away so you get a more affordable price.\n3. Consider taking the train. If train travel is an option, look into train prices to see if it will be affordable. You can often buy rail passes that you can use for many days at a time and there is usually cheaper family pricing. Train travel may be a good option if you are planning to travel across the country, such as within Europe or within a specific area in the U.S. Some train passes also cover admission to certain attractions and excursions in the area you are travelling to. This may be a good option if you want to also save money on attractions for the whole family during your trip.\n4. Take public transit as a family. Public transit, such as buses, light rail, and trams, are ideal if you want to save money when traveling with kids. Get a public transit pass as a family and use it to get around, especially if you are traveling to major cities or destinations. Often, public transit can be a great way to interact with the locals and see different areas from the comfort of your seat. Most public transit passes can be purchased by day or for multiple days. They are often $10 or less, depending on where you are travelling.\n\n\n## Select affordable accommodations\n\n1. Travel during the off-season or shoulder-season. Travelling during the off-season can make your travel expenses more affordable, especially transportation and accommodation costs. Going on your trip during the off-season, usually the fall months, will make hotels and other accommodations cheaper than during peak season. Consider booking your trip during the off-season or during shoulder-season, the time between peak and off-peak. For example, if you’re planning a trip to Walt Disney World, the shoulder-season is May and September, where crowds are thinner and accommodations are more affordable.\n2. Book a home share or a rental property. Finding cheap accommodations when you have kids can be a challenge, especially if you want a space larger than a hotel room. Consider renting a house through online rental property sites. Often, a home rental will have an affordable nightly rate or week by week rate. Having a home rental will also help you to also save money by cooking your own meals and not having to pay for parking, if the home rental has a parking spot already. A home share, where you share a home with other people or another family, can also be an affordable option. You may travel with family and friends and share a large home rental together to cut down on costs.\n3. Use hotel points to book a hotel. If you decide to stay in a hotel while travelling, use hotel points to make it more affordable. Collect points over time through your credit card or another rewards card and use the points to reduce your hotel rates. Try to book a hotel during off-season or shoulder-season so you get a more affordable rate. Sometimes booking a hotel during the week instead of the weekend can be a cheaper option. You can also try looking online for deals on hotels and book it before you leave on your trip. Often rates are cheaper online and booking in advance may save you money.\n4. Go for a family travel package that includes accommodations. If you are traveling to a destination that is known to be popular with kids and families, such as Disneyland, look for travel packages. Travel packages often include airfare and accommodations at a reduced rate. This could be a good way for you to save money and not have to worry about booking your own accommodations, as it is included in the package. If you are travelling to a tropical destination, such as Mexico, you may look into travel packages where you stay at a family friendly resort. Resort packages often include airfare and accommodations.\n5. See if you can stay with friends or family. To really save money on accommodations, see if you can all stay with friends or family who live near your destination. You may plan a trip to see friends or family members who have larger homes where you can all stay together. Or you may set up a blow up mattress that you can then use when staying with family or friends to make your accommodations very cheap.\n\n\n## Plan affordable excursions and activities\n\n1. Book excursions in advance to save money. Do your research and make a list of excursions you want to go to with the kids. Then, book these excursions in advance, if possible. Often, booking excursions in advance can get you a cheaper rate. It will also put less stress on you to figure out things to do once you arrive at your destination. You should also check for family pricing when booking excursions. Often, booking excursions as a group or a family can make them cheaper.\n2. Find free, fun activities for the kids. Excursions can be expensive, even with family pricing. To save money, look for free, fun activities for your kids. Research activities online in the area you are staying in, focusing on those that are free or very cheap. Come up with a fun, free activity for the kids to do while you are traveling. For example, you may book a free tour of the city you are staying in for you and the kids. Or you may take the kids to a play area at the resort you are staying in for free activities. You can also bring books and games from home with you on the trip so the kids have things to do while in the car or in the hotel.\n3. Bring snacks and light meals on excursions. To save money during excursions and activities, make sure you pack snacks and light meals. This way, if your kids get hungry, you have snacks on hand and can avoid eating out all the time. Buy snacks in bulk when you get to your destination. Prepare a few light meals that travel well and bring them when you are out for the day with the kids. For example, healthy snacks like nuts, sliced fruit, and granola bars are all good options. Light meals like sandwiches, mini yogurts, and sliced vegetables are also good for travel.\n",

    "original_question": "Why don't helicopters use reaction wheels to counter the main rotor?",
    "response": "You're talking about a device (in helicopters the tail fan imparting horizontal thrust) that counteracts the torque imparted on the main rotor (and therefore on the helicopter) by the surrounding air as the main rotor is dragged through the air.\n\nYou propose instead to impart an opposite torque through a reaction wheel. That would indeed impart an opposite torque for short lengths of time. However, you don't get a torque from spinning a reaction wheel at constant angular velocity but by changing and accelerating that angular velocity.\n\nNow the torque imparted on the helicopter by the air through the main rotor is steady - or at least its of roughly constant direction. Therefore, to counter that torque, the reaction wheel would have to accelerated uniformly and indefinitely. Clearly this is impossible from an engineering standpoint.\n\nYou can also think of this from a conservation of angular momentum, without thinking about the origin of the torques. The air imparts a steady angular impulse to the helicopter. Therefore, the helicopter system's angular momentum must increase steadily (unless there's a countering torque from the tailfan). So either that angular momentum is the spinning of the helicopter's body (which is what we're trying to avoid) or that of the reaction wheel, whose angular momentum must be steadily increasing under the action of the angular impulse to the system.",

    "original_question": "How to get over a break up fast?",
    "response": "Dealing with a breakup can be very difficult, whether you ended it or they did. Fortunately, things will get better! You can get over your breakup faster by boosting your mood with fun activities and small indulgences. Additionally, use healthy coping strategies to deal with your feelings. As soon as you can, start taking steps to move on with your life.\n\n## Boost your mood\n\n1. Distract yourself with activities that make you feel good. Indulging in distractions is a quick and easy way to make yourself feel good after a breakup. Although it won’t help you overcome your feelings in the long term, a distraction helps you temporarily escape your heartache and feel better while you cope with your feelings. Here are some ways you could temporarily distract yourself from the breakup:\n\t* Engage in your favorite hobby\n\t* Draw or paint something\n\t* Bake treats for your friends\n\t* Join a few friends for a pick up game of baseball, basketball, or football\n\t* Go for a hike\n\t* Browse your favorite shops\n\t* Host a game night with your friends\n\t* See a funny movie\n2. Spend time with friends and family who make you feel good. Being around your biggest supporters can help improve your mood because it will remind you how much you're loved. Plus, you can enjoy fun times with people who aren't your ex, which helps you move past the breakup. If you don't feel up to going out yet, invite friends or family members to enjoy a meal, movie, or game night at your home. You might watch your favorite comedies and order a pizza or play your favorite board games. If you feel like going out, ask a friend to meet you for coffee, plan a fun night out with your friends, or invite friends to go see a movie. As another option, choose an activity that gets you moving, like playing miniature golf, bowling, or walking in a local park.\n3. Fill your schedule so you have less time to dwell on the breakup. Keeping yourself busy gives you less time to think about the breakup. This lessens how much you experience your negative emotions. Go to school or work, volunteer, catch up on errands, help out your friends or relatives, or take up a new hobby. Not only will your mind be off your breakup, but you’ll also be helping both yourself and others. For example, you could fill up your free time by enrolling in an art class, volunteering to care for dogs at the local shelter, and helping your grandmother do her weekly grocery shopping. You’ll get to meet new people, make a difference, and assist a loved one while also having a little fun.\n4. Date yourself by doing fun things your former partner never did with you. Make a list of things you’ve always wanted your partner to do with you, like dancing, going to an art opening, seeing your favorite sports team play a game, or trying a new restaurant. Now that you’re single, take yourself on these “dates.” Doing what you enjoy will help you feel better quickly, plus you’ll see how much better your life can be now. For example, you might see a movie your ex would never watch or go on an outdoor adventure your homebody ex thought would be boring. It’s okay to also invite friends to go with you, but commit to going alone if no one is available to go with you.\n5. Indulge yourself with your favorite treat, a special gift, or a day of pampering. Doing something nice for yourself will help put you in a good mood. Choose something you really want or enjoy. Then, spend a few days indulging your desires. If you can spare the money, make yourself a treat care package or buy yourself something nice. If you’re short on money, try budget ways of pampering yourself, like making a homemade facial mask, taking a hot bath, baking yourself a batch of cookies, going for a walk in the park, or borrowing a movie or game from a friend.\n6. Repeat a positive affirmation that makes you feel better. Affirmations can help you boost your mood if you believe them, so choose an affirmation that resonates with you. Focus on a positive statement that both feels accurate to you and lifts your spirit. Repeat your affirmation whenever you’re feeling down. Here are some examples of positive affirmations:\n\t* “I am worthy of love.”\n\t* “I get validation from myself, not someone else.”\n\t* “I will live my best life.”\n\t* “I am the only one who can make me happy, so I will.”\n\t* “I am a strong, beautiful person.”\n\n\n## Cop with your feel\n\n1. Acknowledge the emotions you’re feeling without judging yourself. It’s normal to feel a range of emotions after a breakup. You’ll likely feel sad or angry, but it’s also possible you’ll feel love for your ex. Don’t try to make yourself stop feeling these emotions. Instead, recognize what you’re feeling, acknowledge it, then let it pass. Accepting your emotions like this will help you get through them more quickly. You’ll also experience less emotional pain. For example, you might say to yourself, “I still feel love for Alex. We dated for a year, so I know this is normal.” Similarly, you might tell yourself, “I’m feeling really sad and betrayed right now. I have a right to feel this way.”\n2. Share your feelings with someone you trust. Talk to a friend or relative who won’t judge you. Tell them what you’ve been going through, and let their responses help you feel better about yourself. Rely on your closest relationships to help you get through the breakup. Choose a few trusted individuals you can talk to so you’ll have several options when you need to talk. That way, you’ll still have someone to turn to if one friend is busy. If you don’t feel like you have someone you can trust, try talking to a counselor or therapist. They can help you work through your feelings in a healthy way.\n3. Write a journal entry about the breakup and how it’s made you feel. Writing about what happened and how you feel can help you get over the breakup faster. Additionally, writing about your goals for the future and how well you are doing can help you direct your attention forward rather than on the past. This is a great way to deal with your feelings if you don’t feel comfortable sharing with others. If your ex really hurt you, write a letter to them telling them how it made you feel. Then, burn or rip up the letter instead of sending it. This can help you release those feelings in a healthy way.\n4. List your ex’s negative traits to help you get over them quickly. Recognizing the flaws in your ex, especially when it came to your relationship, can help you love them less. It helps you let go of your image of them as your partner so you can accept the breakup. While noticing their unfavorable traits or habits will help you get over them fast, it might make you feel sad while you’re doing it. For instance, you might make a list like this one: “1) Doesn’t text me back right away; 2) Talks badly about my sister; 3) Forgot my birthday last year; 4) Eats all of my snacks but never replaces them; 5) Hates cats.”\n5. Allow yourself to cry if you feel like it. It’s normal and healthy to cry after a breakup, especially in the first few days. Crying it out can even help you get over your breakup faster, so don’t fight off those tears. Release them, and the urge to cry will eventually pass. If crying in front of others bothers you, go to a place where you can be alone. This might be your bedroom, a bathroom, or a safe place outside. If you share a room, ask the other person if they will give you a few minutes alone.\n\n\n## Move on with your life\n\n1. Spend some time getting to know yourself before dating again. It’s normal to lose yourself in a relationship, so give yourself time to remember who you are as an individual. Think about what you really want in life, as well as what you want in a partner. Additionally, try out different activities to figure out how you enjoy living your life. Not only will this help you get over your breakup more quickly, it’ll also help you form a healthier relationship with your next partner.\n2. Take good care of yourself by sleeping more, eating well, and exercising. This helps you feel better and reduces your stress. Additionally, you’ll be able to keep your life moving forward instead of falling into bad habits. Here’s how to keep your health on track:\n\t* Create a bedtime routine to help you go to sleep earlier. Turn down your thermostat, turn off your screens, and spend an hour relaxing before bed. Base your meals around lean proteins and vegetables, and snack on fruit, nuts or low-fat dairy. Additionally, drink plenty of water. Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. Go for a walk, run, dance, do aerobics, or take a gym class.\n3. Block your ex on all of your social media accounts. Keeping up with what your ex is doing will keep you trapped in the past. Don’t hold onto the relationship once it’s over. Focus on living your own life without worrying about what they’re doing. You might feel tempted to leave them on your social media accounts so you can show them how well your life is going. Although that might seem satisfying, it’s actually counterproductive because it keeps your thoughts on them. Just let them go. If you have mutual friends with your ex, consider temporarily unfollowing them if you know they’ll be posting about your ex.\n4. Clear out all items that remind you of them. Return any items they left at your home, and donate any gifts you don’t want anymore. Next, throw away or recycle any items that can’t be donated, like cards or uneaten candy. Then, put away photos and momentos you might want later. This will keep your mind off your ex so you can focus on the future. You don’t have to get rid of everything they gave you or every memory you made together. Use your best judgement when deciding what to keep. If it doesn’t remind you of them, you might choose to keep it. Similarly, you might put away photos of you with them until a later time when the breakup no longer bothers you.\n5. Focus on your personal goals to positively direct your attention. Choose a goal you hope to accomplish, like writing a book, getting picked for a sports team, or getting a promotion at work. Break up that goal into several small steps, then start working on them. This helps you focus on building a future you want instead of dwelling on the past. For example, let’s say your goal is to take a trip to Paris, France. Your to-do list might include “buy a Paris travel guide,” “get a passport,” “read about popular tourist sites in Paris,” “research hotels,” “price my trip,” “choose a target date,” “save money for my trip,” “book my trip,” and “go to Paris.”\n",

    "generated_instruction": "How do you host a sleepover with guests aged 7-12 that will please every one?",
    "original_question": "How to host a sleepover party for a wide range of ages?",
    "response": "If you are throwing a sleepover with guests with ages ranging from seven to twelve (e.g. you are having all your cousins round), it can be tough finding activities to suit everyone. Here are a few games and other activities that will make a wide age ranged sleepover a success.\n\n## Be prepare\n\n1. Before the sleepover you should have a list of \"back up ideas\" for if your sleepover dips. It can happen in the best of sleepovers. One minute, everyone can be having great fun and then the next everyone's arguing or someone starts missing home. For these occasions, you should have a list of back ups that will bring the mood up again. The activities should be fun and not very competitive like hide and seek or just chilling and watching a movie. However if you are going to be playing team games make sure you don't put people who are arguing on the same team.\n2. Get to know your guests. You probably already know a lot about them but if you don't you should find out. It just makes it a lot easier to choose: food, drinks, activities, themes and lots more.\n3. Before the sleepover, you should also decide wether or not to have a theme. Themes can be fun and make your party that tiny bit of extra fun but they can also limit your choices. If you are going to choose a theme then make sure that it suits everyone. For example, if you are doing a princess theme don't have one person not dressed up and left out because they don't really like princesses you either have to rethink the theme or rethink inviting that person. Some theme ideas are:\n\t* princess\n\t* disney\n\t* under the sea\n\t* safari\n\t* a color\n\t* christmas\n\t* Hawaii\n\t* Halloween\n\t* a book you all like\n\t* a TV show or movie you all like\n\t* sporty\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Since it's a sleepover, you should go all out on the sweets and drinks. Sugary stuff is great, but remember to have other options e.g. pizza, crackers or even fruit because sometimes at 3:00am you might not feel like chocolate or other sugary foods. Remember to check if your guests are vegetarian or vegan or have allergies because a trip to the hospital at 2:00am because Molly ate a Snickers when she has nut allergies will definitely put a damper on the night.\n2. For drinks, make sure you have lots of fizzy juice, try and get stuff you might not normally buy because it is a sleepover. For example maybe if you see some blueberry fizzy juice at your local super market. Even if you all hate it, it could still come in handy for penalties in truth of dare. Once again remember to check if your guests have allergies.\n\n\n## When to go to bed\n\n1. At a sleepover the time you go to bed and the time you fall asleep are two very different times. If there are younger kids (6-7 years old) maybe pulling an allnighter isn't the best idea because it will be you who puts up with the temper tantrums the next day.\n2. Everyones different but it probably isn't a good idea to make younger kids go to bed earlier than the older kids because they will be to anxious about thinking about what they are missing to sleep.\n3. A good idea is to watch a movie while in bed then the younger ones might doze off if it's late (some of the older kids might as well) and then the kids who are still awake can talk or play a quiet game.\n\n\n## Game\n\n1. It can be tough finding games that will suit all age groups because what a 7 year old would find fun a 12 year old probably won't, but there are ways of modifying games so that everyone has a good time.\n2. Murder in the Dark is a very good classic sleepover game and its bundles of fun.There are many different ways of playing but this way is my favorite. Before your guests arrive, cut out cards that are all the same size (one for each guest e.g. if there are 5 people coming make 5 cards) write murderer on one and detective on another and suspect on the rest. If there are children coming who can't read/are not confident readers draw a shape beside each one and for example say - if you have a square on your card you are the murderer. Everyone keeps their card a secret. The lights go out and if you are the murderer you have to tap people and they have to scream and fall over however if you are the detective and you get tapped you have to put the lights on and try and guess you the murderer is. If they guess right they win but if they don't the murderer wins.\n3. Hide and Seek in the dark is another good game.\n4. If you and your guests like making movies then go for it. There are loads of great apps that can help you with that and they are a great way to remember your sleepover.\n5. Make friendship bracelets.\n6. Build a den. Indoor or outdoor dens/forts are great fun to make and fun to hide out in. They are also great because all kids from 7 to 12 mostly like making dens so its something everyone can join in with.\n7. Pillow fights are also great just make sure the pillows don't have any hard zips or anything on them.\n",

    "original_question": "24601 has developed into being an iconic part of both the Les Miserables book and musical. Was that number special to him, or was it simply a random number he chose (I doubt it)?",
    "response": "Yes: it corresponds to the date of Hugo's conception.\nThis is part of a pattern of similarities between the character of Jean Valjean and the author himself: both are of similar age, have similar habits and similarly austere lifestyles, and even share the same dreams. This is according to David Bellos's The Novel of the Century: The Extraordinary Adventure of Les Misérables, which concludes Part Three with:\n\nBut Hugo put in a secret sign to remind himself and maybe those who knew him well that there were deep links of identity between the dutiful and persistent ex-convict and himself. Hugo was born on 26 February 1802, but because he was a slightly premature baby, he always believed he had been conceived on 24 June 1801. Valjean's prison number on his first incarceration at Toulon is 24601.\n-- p. 162 (emphasis mine)\n\nAs a bonus, Valjean's second prisoner number was apparently also chosen for its special significance to Hugo: it refers to the month of his daughter Léopoldine's death. From footnote 46 in Kathryn Grossman's Figuring Transcendence in Les Miserables: Hugo's Romantic Sublime:\n\nGaudon demonstrates that this image, which represents genius in one of the poet's earliest carnets (8 July 1820), is a sign of his &quot;deep identification&quot; with Valjean (Temps 547). As further evidence that the hero is an alter ego, Gohin cites the two numbers assigned to him in prison. The first, 24601, refers to the supposed date of Hugo's conception (24 June 1801), while the second, 9430, alludes to Léopoldine's death in September 1843 (&quot;Une histoire&quot; 47; see also 52).\n-- p. 165 (emphasis mine)\n",

    "original_question": "I see hugely varied performance depending on how many newlines there are in the file I'm visiting.\nHere's an example. I have two JSON files:\n```$ wget https://github.com/Wilfred/ReVo-utilities/blob/a4bdc40dd2656c496defc461fc19c403c8306d9f/revo-export/dictionary.json?raw=true -O one_line.json\n$ python -m json.tool pretty_printed.json\n```\nThese are two JSON files with the same content. ```one_line.json``` is 18MiB of JSON without any newlines. ```pretty_printed.json``` has newlines and whitespace added, making it 41MiB.\nHowever, the bigger file split over many lines is much faster to open in Emacs, both in Javascript mode and Fundamental mode.\nWhy does Emacs have such poor performance with long lines, since it's actually fewer bytes? Is there anything I can do to improve performance without reformatting the data outside of Emacs?",
    "response": "Emacs' handling of long lines is not very well optimized. For a number of operations, Emacs has to scan the whole line repeatedly. For example, to display a line, Emacs has to figure out the height of the line, which requires scanning the whole line to find the tallest glyph. Additionally, scanning for bidirectional display eats up a lot of time. You can get some additional information in, for example, the docstring of ```cache-long-line-scans``` (renamed ```cache-long-scans``` in 24.4).\n\nYou can try and see if setting ```bidi-paragraph-direction``` to ```left-to-right``` and setting ```bidi-inhibit-bpa``` (new in Emacs 27, see footnote 1) to ```t``` improves the speed for you (see footnote 2). This removes some significant contributors to line scans, but sadly not the only ones.\n\nThe best option is to add newlines. You can pipe a JSON file through e.g. ```python -c 'import json, sys ; json.dump(json.load(sys.stdin), sys.stdout, indent=2)'``` to add newlines and improve readability in general.\n\nFootnote 1: ```bidi-inhibit-bpa``` is new in Emacs 27.  Setting it to ```t``` can have a noticeable (sometimes dramatic) effect in cases where (a) a physical line is very long, and (b) the line includes many parentheses and/or braces, especially if they are nested.\nFootnote 2: There is also ```bidi-display-reordering```, but this is only for internal/debugging purposes.  Setting it to ```nil``` may improve performance, however that is an unsupported setting which may cause other problems, so it is not recommended.  In Emacs 27, the combination of setting ```bidi-paragraph-direction``` and ```bidi-inhibit-bpa``` is a supported configuration which provides approximately the same performance boost.",

    "original_question": "Give me a one-line summary of the article: \nChange is coming to Ferguson. In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change?\n\nThe report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time.\n\nCourt costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, \"a collection agency\" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents.\n\nThe evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were \"no racial issues\" in his department.\n\nFerguson's ugly, racist emails released\n\nThe recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.)\n\nWithout question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black.\n\nFerguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest.\n\nJackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson.\n\nBut does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department.\n\nIndeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process.\n\nEqually important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns..\n\nThe Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department.\n\nBut there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States.\n\nThat form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance.\n\nIn any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country.\n\nLikewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do.\n\nIt's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high.\n\nFerguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population.\n\nChange is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.",

    "original_question": "Why is there so much technical detail of whaling included in Moby-Dick?",
    "response": "There are multiple purposes behind the novel structure of Moby-Dick.\n\nIn the first instance the author was himself a whaleman, having spent 18 months as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler Acushnet in 1841–42. In his experience the literature of the day, such as Miriam \n\nCoffin or The Whale-Fisherman by Joseph Hart, did not portray whaling accurately but rather sensationalised it. He wished to provide his readers with a more realistic account.\n\nIn doing so, he also gave the reader the information necessary to better understand and appreciate the passages of whaling described in the novel. With the reader forewarned, he is able to keep the narrative passages tense and exciting. It is interesting that, early in the novel, the Pequod meets virutally no whales and that the chases become longer and more involved as the story progresses. This may be because Melville felt he needed to give the reader more and more technical information before they could fully appreicate these encounters, but understood the science would need to be spaced out among the narrative.\n\nIn describing it to the reader, the science also serves another useful narrative function. It indicates that on whaling voyages, long periods of time pass when nothing much happens at all. By padding out of the story with scientific digressions serves as a useful narrative metaphor for waiting.\n\nThe level of detail provided also mirrors one of the novel's central themes: obsession. Although Ishmael is the narrator and Ahab the obvious obsessive, the amount of science indicates that Ishmael is also an obsessive. His obsession is the business of whaling itself.\n\nFinally, Melville made good use of these passages in serving as metaphors for other themes of the novel where he felt it appropriate. For example in the chapter The Line, which describes how the whale line is stored and used in the boat, it ends by using the line as a metaphor.\n\n  \"All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\"\n",

    "response": "If you open up a ```bash``` prompt and type in an ```echo``` command, that uses a shell builtin rather than running ```/bin/echo```. The reasons it is still important for ```/bin/echo``` to exist are:\n\n* You're not always using a shell. Under a variety of circumstances, you run an executable directly and not through a shell.\n* At least in theory, some shells don't have an ```echo``` builtin.  This is not actually required.\n\nTo expand on #1, suppose you wanted to move all the regular files whose names started with ```abc``` anywhere in ```src``` to ```dest```. There are several ways to do that but one of them is:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut suppose, rather than just running that, you want to see every command that will be run first. Well, then you can prepend ```echo``` to the command, just as you might in other contexts:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec echo mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut ```find``` doesn't use a shell. That runs ```/bin/echo```.\nBesides ```find``` with ```-exec``` or ```-execdir```, the ```/bin/echo``` executable will be called by other programs that themselves run programs but not through a shell. This happens with the ```xargs``` command (which is related to ```find```), as well as in a number of other contexts, such as the ```Exec=``` line of a ```.desktop``` file. Another example is when you run ```sudo echo```, which can be handy for testing if ```sudo``` is working.\nSimilarly, some shells have a ```printf``` builtin but ```/usr/bin/printf``` also exists.\nA less common possible reason you might deliberately use ```/bin/echo``` is if you were relying on the differences between it and the ```echo``` command provided by your shell. ```man echo``` documents ```/bin/echo```; ```help echo``` in  ```bash``` documents the ```bash``` builtin. ```echo``` is not very portable, because different implementations--both across operating systems and across shells on the same operating system--support different options (e.g., ```-e```) and differ in their treatment of backslashes. Of course, it's better to avoid relying on such details, and use ```printf``` instead, which is far more portable.\nIn ```bash```, you can make the ```type``` builtin show ```/bin/echo``` as well--assuming ```/bin``` is in your ```$PATH``` as it always should be--by passing it the ```-a``` flag:\n```$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is /bin/echo\n```",

    "response": "People are resources, dictators (and oppressive regimes in general) don't want them to defect to other countries because they want them working for their regime. Some of them are going to be people that the regime has put their resources into, like scientists and doctors, but even laborers are valuable for actually gathering and assembling the resources the regime needs. Additionally, the regime especially does not want people with access to sensitive information to defect to their enemies. That isn't just spies and soldiers, there are plenty of \"regular\" government positions that require access to something the regime would not want falling into enemy hands, like economic data that could be used for propaganda. Obviously this is true of any country, and even in democracies with strong human rights records, people with access to classified information are usually required to submit to strict scrutiny of their international travel. Given that they aren't concerned with human rights, dictatorships can take the easier option of restricting travel to any citizens.\nHowever, defection is really a piece of a bigger issue - oppressive regimes maintain their rule in part by controlling information. Here's an interesting article that talks about how dictatorships keep power. Jerrold Post, director of the political psychology program at George Washington University, is referenced:\n\n  Post said that in both Iraq and North Korea, dictators tightly controlled the flow of information. That control was upended in the past two years during the \"Arab spring\" revolts that swept away despots in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and some of the Gulf states, revolts that were encouraged in large part by information spread by cell phones and social media. \n\nNorth Korea is probably the most extreme example of information control (according to Reporters without Borders, they are dead last in Press Freedom in the world), but this can be seen in other oppressive regimes - for example, China attempts to limit access to \"wrong\" information via its Great Firewall. This is thrown out the window if citizens go somewhere with free media and realize they are being lied to. Traveling can be the cause of their dissension, rather than a symptom.\nKnown dissidents may also be restricted from traveling so that they can not coordinate with foreign countries or anti-dictatorship organizations, and to prevent them from smuggling contraband or evidence of the regime's misinformation back into the country. Regimes can control the information originating in their country, but once someone is outside their borders the regime cannot control who they speak with.",

If you sweat a lot, such as after a workout, then take another shower.\n2. Use a gentle cleanser to clean your neck. Find a gentle cleanser that is labeled as “non-comedogenic” or “oil-free” to use on your neck. Products that are non-comedogenic will not clog your pores so they should help to clear up your neck acne. Check the label to be sure that a product is non-comedogenic. Check to make sure that the products you buy are alcohol-free as well. Alcohol may irritate your neck acne and make it worse.\n3. Apply cleanser to your neck using only your fingers. Do not use a washcloth, sponge, or other abrasive materials to apply cleanser to your neck because this can cause irritation, scarring, and worsen the existing acne. Instead, use your fingertips to gently apply the cleanser to your neck. Do not scrub aggressively. Rinse your neck well after you finish washing it. Pat your neck dry with a clean cotton towel.\n4. Avoid irritants. You may not realize it, but your clothing or accessories may be contributing to your neck acne and making it worse. Avoid tight collared shirts, scarves, and turtlenecks, as these may irritate the acne. Make sure anything that touches your neck is clean. Also, avoid touching the area and never pick at or scratch your acne, as this can cause scarring. Try not to use oily sunscreens and don't cover the acne with foundation or makeup. If you use a hairstyling product, make sure it doesn't come in contact with your neck. If you have long hair, the oil from your hair may be getting on the back of your neck. Try wearing your hair up in a ponytail while you treat your acne.\n\n\n## Use a sea salt treatment\n\n1. Gather your ingredients. Making a sea salt treatment is easy and the ingredients are available in most grocery stores. It exfoliates your skin and can dry out acne. To make a sea salt treatment, you will need:\n\t* 1 cup hot water\n\t* 1 teaspoon sea salt\n\t* Green tea bag and/or 1 – 2 tablespoons aloe vera\n2. Brew a cup of green tea. Green tea extract has been found to be effective as a treatment for acne, but using a cup of green tea as a base for this treatment should also help. You can either use one teaspoon of green tea leaves in a tea infuser or use a green tea bag. Place the tea bag or infuser into a mug. Then, boil some water and pour about 1 cup of water over the green tea. Let the tea steep for about three minutes and then remove the tea bag or infuser.\n3. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of sea salt in the tea. Measure out 1 teaspoon of sea salt and add it to the cup of tea. Stir the sea salt until it completely dissolves in the tea.\n4. Add a tablespoon of aloe vera. Aloe vera has been found to be effective against acne and it also has moisturizing properties. You can add this instead of the tea, or try combining the green tea and aloe vera into one mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of aloe vera to the sea salt solution and stir well. If you want to skip the green tea and only use aloe vera, mix 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel with 1 tablespoon of sea salt. This will make a scrub that you can apply directly to your neck.\n5. Apply the mixture to your neck. Make sure that the solution is not so hot that it might burn your neck. Allow it to cool down a bit first. Then, you can apply the solution by soaking a clean cotton washcloth in the solution and placing the cloth over your neck. If you only have few places that you want to treat, then you can dip a cotton swab or cotton ball into the solution and apply it as needed.\n6. Leave the solution on for about five minutes. Don’t leave the sea salt solution on your skin any longer or it may dry out your skin too much. After time is up, rinse off your neck with lukewarm water and gently dry off your neck with a clean, cotton towel.\n7. Moisturize your neck. After the sea salt treatment, apply some moisturizer to your neck. Make sure that you use a non-comedogenic moisturizer to avoid making the acne worse.\n8. Repeat the sea salt treatment once per day. Do not use this treatment more than once per day or you may dry out your skin too much, even if you moisturize after. Limit yourself to one sea salt treatment per day.\n\n\n## Use an egg white mask\n\n1. Gather your ingredients. Some of the things you can readily find in your kitchen are thought to have antibacterial and healing properties, allowing you to quickly whip up an acne-fighting mask. You will need:\n\t* 1/2 tablespoon of dark colored honey (darker honey has more antibacterial properties)\n\t* 1 egg white (do not use the yolk)\n\t* 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice\n2. Combine the ingredients in a small bowl. Use a whisk or fork to mix the egg white and lemon juice until it becomes frothy, then add the honey. Make sure that everything is well combined. You may wish to add other household items, such as 1 teaspoon of witch hazel (which has anti-inflammatory properties) or a few drops of an essential oil like peppermint, spearmint, lavender, or calendula, but it is unclear if these will enhance or reduce the effectiveness of the treatment.\n3. Spread the paste over your neck. If you want to treat your whole neck, then you can use your fingers to spread the paste over your neck. If you want to treat a smaller area, then you can use a cotton swab or cotton ball to spread the paste over specific problem areas.\n4. Allow the paste to dry on your neck and then rinse. Leave the paste alone for about 15 minutes, then rinse it away with lukewarm water. You may need to hop in the shower to do this. Use your fingers to break up the paste as you rinse it away. Pat your skin dry and then apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to complete the treatment.\n\n\n## Treat neck acne with medication\n\n1. Try over-the-counter treatments. Face washes and topical treatments containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, or resorcinol acid are all effective acne-fighters and are available over-the-counter. You may find products targeted specifically at treating body acne, which may be more effective than products meant to be used on your face. Just make sure you don't forget and use the body product on the delicate skin of your face or the front of your neck.\n2. Ask about retinoid creams. Retinoid creams can help to unclog your pores and eliminate acne on your neck, but you will need to get a prescription from your doctor or dermatologist.\n3. Discuss the use of antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe a prescription-strength topical antibiotic, such as clindamycin, to apply to your neck, which kills acne-causing bacteria. It may also reduce redness. You will need to apply it twice daily and combine it with benzoyl peroxide, as this prevents the bacteria from becoming immune to the antibiotic.\n4. Talk to your doctor about oral contraceptive pills if you are a woman. Oral contraceptives can help to reduce acne in some women, but only if the acne is related to shifts in your hormones. Keep in mind that oral contraceptives have side effects and they should not be used if you are planning to become pregnant.\n5. Consider steroid injections for cystic acne. If your dermatologist determines that the acne on the back of your neck is a nodular or cystic lesion, your doctor may decide to inject the lesion directly with a steroid. This can quickly reduce swelling and heal the acne. It may also reduce scarring. Side effects of this treatment include thinning of the skin, increased sensitivity to light, and may temporarily case the fat under your skin to atrophy, giving the area a \"sunken\" appearance.\n6. Consider isotretinoin for severe acne. Isotretinoin is a strong medicine that should only be used if other methods of controlling acne fail to work. Isotretinoin can clear up severe acne in a couple of months, but it also has some severe risks including:\n\t* Ulcerative colitis\n\t* Liver damage\n\t* Inflammatory bowel disease\n\t* Depression\n\t* Bone changes\n\t* Severe birth defects\n7. Look into laser treatments for acne. Laser treatments can also help to get rid of acne by reducing the size of oil glands and making them less active as well. Some forms of laser therapy also use topical medicine to make the laser more effective. Keep in mind that you will need multiple treatments in order for laser therapy to work.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "Hello there!\nI'd like to ask a question. I recently got interested in the creation of the world by YEC (Young Earth Creationist), and I stumbled upon an interesting explanation by Hugh Ross. But, I have to question it. YEC and Hugh Ross both explain the 40 day darkness and how it is possible for an entire galaxy's worth of stars to appear all at once.\nHere's Hugh Ross's way of putting it: \"Now when Jesus said \"there was light\" during the first creation week, some have taken it to be saying there was not only visible light in the sun, but also an explosion of",
    "original_question": "In this Creation magazine reprint of a 1994 article titled Exploding stars point to a young universe,  Young-Earth Creationist, Jonathan Sarfati argues that the scarcity of Supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sky suggests the Milky Way galaxy is less than billions of years old.\n\nOn average, a galaxy like our own, the Milky Way, should produce one supernova every 25 years.\n[...]\nAs can be readily seen above, a young universe model fits the data of the low number of observed SNRs. If the universe was really billions of years old, there are 7000 missing SNRs in our galaxy.\n\nDoes astronomy predict a Milky Way supernova every 25 years? Are there missing SNRs that undermine these predictions?",
    "response": "There are many reasons why this is wrong. The first one is the assumption of 1 supernova per 25 years. That was the value arrived at in Gustav Tammann's article published in 1970. Others got values up to 100 years (Tammann himself changed his value later). All these values are really only good guesses.\n\nWorse errors are made in the percentage of remnants that should be visible. To start with, only a small percentage of them are visible; the others are obscured by dust in the galaxy. This does not happen to the same extent to the supernovas themselves, as they are intrinsically very much brighter. \n\nSarfati also uses an old paper to come up with the number of remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way). However, that figure was considered to be wrong (and much smaller) in later studies. Older remnants are very difficult to distinguish against a background of dust in the galaxy. Many of them disappear completely after about 10,000 years or so.\n\nIt should be noted that, using Sarfati's own reasoning, we should not be able to see any remnants older than 6000 years. Instead, we know of remnants (e.g. G166.2 + 2.5) that are over 100,000 years old. How did those originate in his universe? The same goes for the distance to supernovas. The distance to SN 1987A has been trigonometrically measured at 167,000 light years (the paper says 51,200 parsecs). In other words, its light took more than 30 times longer to reach us than the creationist universe has supposedly existed. \n\nRemember also that a supernova typically becomes either a pulsar or a black hole, both of which are very hard to observe. A black hole can only be \"seen\" through its effects on other matter, and a pulsar is mainly visible if the solar system happens to be in line with its sweeping radio beam (with some pulsars the star itself has also been seen). Hence, all we can see of them long after the event is an expanding cloud of gas that gets dimmer over the millennia.\n\nThere are several other reasons which are covered in a very good article on TalkOrigins. That article has links to all the original scientific papers referred to, so you can check the validity yourself.",

    "original_question": "Why can't we kill ourselves by holding our breath?",
    "response": "## Short answer\nHealthy people cannot hold their breaths until unconsciousness sets in, let alone commit suicide.\n\n## Background\nAccording to Parkes (2005), a normal person cannot even hold their breath to unconsciousness, let alone death. Parkes says:\n\n  Breath‐holding is a voluntary act, but normal subjects appear unable\n  to breath‐hold to unconsciousness. A powerful involuntary mechanism\n  normally overrides voluntary breath‐holding and causes the breath that\n  defines the breakpoint.\n\nParkes explains that voluntary breath‐holding does not stop the central respiratory rhythm. Instead, breath holding merely suppresses its expression by voluntarily holding the chest at a certain volume. At the time of writing, no simple explanation for the break point existed. It is known to be caused by partial pressures of blood gases activating the carotid arterial chemoreceptors. They are peripheral sensory neurons that detect changes in chemical concentrations, including low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). Both hypoxia and hypercapnia are signs of breath holding and both are detected by the chemoreceptors. These receptors send nerve signals to the vasomotor center of the medulla which eventually overrides the conscious breath holding.\n\nThe breaking point can be postponed by large lung inflations, hyperoxia and hypocapnia, and it is shortened by increased metabolic rates.\n\nReference\n- Parkes, Exp Physiol (2006); 91(1): 1-15",

    "generated_instruction": "What's the best way to clean houseplants?",
    "original_question": "How to clean plant leaves?",
    "response": "Clean plants are a beautiful addition to your home and garden, and do a wonderful job of purifying the air. Choose a cleaning method that is safe for your plant, especially if your plant is sensitive to water. Experiment with different shine agents to add a beautiful glow to your plant leaves. Each of these strategies will leave your plants looking clean and shiny.\n\n## Remove dust and grime\n\n1. Wipe large, shiny leaves with a damp cloth. This is the best way to clean large plants, such as rubber plants, that are difficult to move. Dunk your cloth in water and then squeeze out any excess liquid. Gently wipe both sides of all of the leaves to remove any dust and grime. Microfiber cloths or cheesecloths work well for cleaning plants. Clean the leaves each time that you notice dust or dirt building up. This works well for both indoor and outdoor plants such as Gunnera, Plantain Lillies, and Elephant Ears. Place a drop of dishwashing liquid on the cloth if you notice insects eating or landing on your plant.\n2. Use a soft paintbrush to remove dust from plants with fuzzy leaves. Plants with fluffy leaves, such as African Violets, are quite delicate and shouldn’t be wiped. Instead, gently brush any dust or insects off the leaves with a clean, soft paintbrush. If you don’t have a soft paintbrush on-hand, use a pipe cleaner or soft toothbrush instead. Avoid wetting the leaves of fuzzy plants, as this can cause water spots to appear.\n3. Rinse indoor plant leaves with warm water to remove insects and dust. Place your indoor plant in the sink or shower and use the pressure of the water stream to remove any dust and dirt from the plant. The mist from the shower will also help to hydrate the plant’s leaves. Leave the plants to drip-dry and then take them outside to dry in the sunshine. Always use warm water, as cold water can leave spots on the leaves. Don’t wash plants, such as cacti and African Violets, that are sensitive to water. This method works well for Peace Lilies, Sword Ferns, and Devils Ivy.\n4. Dunk small plants into water to quickly get rid of dust. Place your hand over the soil to keep it in place and then turn the plant upside down and submerge the plant in room temperature water. This is a great option for small houseplants and outdoor plants. Allow the plants to drip-dry out of direct light.\n5. Spray compressed air onto cacti to avoid getting them wet. Cacti are used to desert conditions and will often wilt and die if they are over-watered. Spray air from an air compressor can over the spikes to dislodge any dust or dirt from the cacti. Hold the can 10 centimetres (3.9 in) away from the cacti to avoid damaging the spikes. Purchase an air-compressor can from a hardware store or a plant nursery. This works well for both spiky and smooth cacti.\n\n\n## Add shine\n\n1. Rub a thin coat of mayonnaise over the leaves to keep them shiny. Squeeze a little mayonnaise onto a paper towel and wipe it over the leaves. Cover the entire leave with a light enough coat that it cannot be seen. Remove any excess mayonnaise with a clean paper towel. This shiny coating will last for approximately 2 weeks. Simply reapply the mayonnaise to restore the shine of the leaves. This method works for all types of plants.\n2. Cover the leaves in a thin layer of mineral oil for a long-lasting glow. Mineral oil provides a shiny coating for the leaves and helps to prevent dust from accumulating quickly. Simply place a drop of mineral oil onto each leaf and use your fingers to evenly spread it over the top side of the leaf. Use this method on any type of plant. Avoid using coconut or olive oil on the leaves, as this can block the pores of the plant. Keep plants with mineral oil on them out of the direct sun to avoid the leaves from getting burnt. Reapply the mineral oil once or twice per year.\n3. Spray a commercial plant shining product onto the leaves to add sheen. These sprays are specially formulated to keep your plant leaves looking shiny. Liberally spray the product over all the leaves on your plants. If you are spraying outdoor plants, choose a product that is designed for outdoor plants. Purchase a plant shining spray from a plant store. Follow the application instructions on the packet. This is a great option for cacti, as you don’t have to touch the plant.\n",

    "original_question": "How to make a cat tree?",
    "response": "Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "The English language often has homophones such as \"bite\" and \"sight\". However, \"elite\" doesn't follow this pattern even though \"elite\" looks like it would fit the pattern. Why is this?",
    "original_question": "Why does \"elite\" rhyme with \"beet\" rather than \"bite\"?",
    "response": "This has everything to do with the following:\n\n* The language of origin of the word and\n* The point at which the word entered the English language.\n\nThe reason that the words &quot;light&quot; and &quot;might&quot; and &quot;site&quot; have a diphthong is because they were present in spoken English during the Great Vowel Shift, which started in the 1400s and continued for a few hundred years. So words that had already entered the English language underwent that change in pronunciation. Those words could be of Anglo-Saxon, Norman French, or Latin origin. We see it across the board.\nHowever, the word elite entered English towards the end of the period of the Great Vowel shift. The first attestation is in the mid 1700s (1738 in the OED). This is probably further complicated by the fact that French has long been the language of nobility, so there are certain pressures to maintain the pronunciation patterns of the origin language.\n&quot;Elite&quot; joined the party a little bit late, so its pronunciation remained rather stable.\nAs Rjpond points out, elite is a modern borrowing. Words like crime, sublime, mime, etc. are older borrowings.\nTo note: There are early occurrences of the word &quot;elite&quot; in around 1400, with the meaning of a &quot;bishop elect&quot;. This sense of the word died out and is now marked as archaic. So when &quot;elite&quot; was re-introduced (directly from French) in the 1700s, there was no existing pronunciation.\n\nSmall addendum:\nAlready existing in English is another word that already occupies the same lexical space that elite would occupy, if the pronunciation were analogized to bite: alight, which dates back to Old English. (It's a lovely word.)\nYou might say that there is some linguistic pressure to avoid creating homophones: elite vs. alight.",

Is there anything better that will mangle* my data less.\n* For example, GEDCOM can lose some data where the two ends of the system understand a concept which  GEDCOM does not have a field for.",
    "response": "GEDCOM is the defacto standard for exchanging genealogical data. There are some problems with GEDCOM.\n\n* It is not rich enough to hold all the types of information that different vendor systems manage internally. So exporting GEDCOM from one system may lose information that that system actually holds. Though see point 4 below.\n* There is enough ambiguity in the definition of GEDCOM that different vendors have interpreted a few parts of the format inconsistently. Though they support the same tags, they can't consistently share data that uses those tags.\n* Some systems don't implement all parts of the GEDCOM format. So, when they import GEDCOM data that includes those parts, they lose that information.\n* GEDCOM has facilities that allow different vendors to extend it by adding new tags that allow them to add new types of data to GEDCOM. Others systems that do not use the same set of extensions looe that information on import.\n\nThere have been a few attempts to create new standards and formats for exchanging genealogical data. An older one that is often mentioned is the GenTech model. Recently there have been two efforts underway, Better GEDCOM and GEDCOM-X. Better GEDCOM is now inactive. However, the currently developing FHISO effort evolved from it. GEDCOM-X is an effort of Family Search (an organ of the LDS) and is currently a work in progress.\nA number of individuals have also offered up new formats for archiving and tranferring genealogical data.

    "generated_instruction": "Describe the implementation of std::function. Explain why different std::function objects can't store the same functor. Explain why a copy of a std::function object can't work with the same functor.",
    "original_question": "According to the sources I have found, a lambda expression is essentially implemented by the compiler creating a class with overloaded function call operator and the referenced variables as members. This suggests that the size of lambda expressions varies, and given enough references variables that size can be arbitrarily large.\nAn ```std::function``` should have a fixed size, but it must be able to wrap any kind of callables, including any lambdas of the same kind. How is it implemented? If ```std::function``` internally uses a pointer to its target, then what happens, when the ```std::function``` instance is copied or moved? Are there any heap allocations involved?",
    "response": "The implementation of ```std::function``` can differ from one implementation to another, but the core idea is that it uses type-erasure. While there are multiple ways of doing it, you can imagine a trivial (not optimal) solution could be like this (simplified for the specific case of ```std::function<int (double)>``` for the sake of simplicity):\n```struct callable_base {\n   virtual int operator()(double d) = 0;\n   virtual ~callable_base() {}\n};\ntemplate <typename F>\nstruct callable : callable_base {\n   F functor;\n   callable(F functor) : functor(functor) {}\n   virtual int operator()(double d) { return functor(d); }\n};\nclass function_int_double {\n   std::unique_ptr<callable_base> c;\npublic:\n   template <typename F>\n   function(F f) {\n      c.reset(new callable<F>(f));\n   }\n   int operator()(double d) { return c(d); }\n// ...\n};\n```\nIn this simple approach the ```function``` object would store just a ```unique_ptr``` to a base type. For each different functor used with the ```function```, a new type derived from the base is created and an object of that type instantiated dynamically. The ```std::function``` object is always of the same size and will allocate space as needed for the different functors in the heap.\nIn real life there are different optimizations that provide performance advantages but would complicate the answer. The type could use small object optimizations, the dynamic dispatch can be replaced by a free-function pointer that takes the functor as argument to avoid one level of indirection, but the idea is basically the same.\n\nRegarding the issue of how copies of the ```std::function``` behave, a quick test indicates that copies of the internal callable object are done, rather than sharing the state.\n```// g++4.8\nint main() {\n   int value = 5;\n   typedef std::function<void()> fun;\n   fun f1 = [=]() mutable { std::cout << value++ << '\\n' };\n   fun f2 = f1;\n   f1();                    // prints 5\n   fun f3 = f1;\n   f2();                    // prints 5\n   f3();                    // prints 6 (copy after first increment)\n}\n```\nThe test indicates that ```f2``` gets a copy of the callable entity, rather than a reference. If the callable entity was shared by the different ```std::function<>``` objects, the output of the program would have been 5, 6, 7.",

    "original_question": "How to make your own decorations for halloween?",
    "response": "There are thousands of Halloween decorations you could go out to the store and buy, but often they look generic and plastic-y, don't they? Why not make your own? Using household items, you can make your own ghosts, bats, spiders, and pumpkins! Here's how.\n\n## Ghostly spirit jugs\n\n1. Clean several plastic milk jugs. You don't need to cut them out or in any way modify them -- they just need to be clean. Each one will be one ghost -- how many milk jugs do you need?\n2. Draw a face on the jugs. You can either use a black permanent marker, felt, or any material you have lying around the house. The permanent marker will be the easiest to make a detailed face with. While you do this, only work on the side without the handles and leave the caps on the jugs. The air forced to stay inside by the caps will make it easier to work with, keeping it sturdy. You don't have to go Martha Stewart on this project. Just a circle for a mouth and circles for eyes (leave a little white for the pupils) can be cute, too.\n3. Cut a small hole in the back of the jug. Use a craft knife to cut a hole the size of a half dollar or a bit bigger than a pound coin. Place the hole about 2/3 of the way up the jug. This won't be seen. If it's not perfect, don't worry about it. Just don't leave any sharp edges!\n4. Stuff the jug with Christmas or fairy lights. You can either use a whole string for one jug, or thread several jugs with a single string. Arrange the jugs together, plug in the cord, and voila! These little buggers work great lining a walk or a patio or table edge. They dim the lighting just enough to glow in a very Halloween-y feel!\n\n\n## Flapping bats\n\n1. Cut a body, two wings, and the head of a bat (with ears!) out of a piece of paper. You can find a template online or you can freehand it. Make the body a little on the chubby side so you have room to attach the wings without drawing away from its size.\n2. Trace your template onto black craft foam. Cut out the foam to match the template. This project looks best if you have about 6 or so bats. They need friends!\n3. Punch several holes into the bat to join the pieces together. Punch two holes on each wing, close to where the wings would attach to the body. Leave a little space around all sides so the holes don't turn into rips. Also punch a hole at the bottom of the body, to attach a string later (around where a tail would be). The holes just have to be big enough to put a metal brad through. This is how the wings will flap.\n4. Align the holes on the body and the wings together and fasten with a brad. Since there are two holes on each side, use the one that's closest to the wing tip. Place a paper fastener or a brad through the hole and secure loosely (it's best to use a black fastener or color your gold brad).\n5. Thread a string through the empty holes and tie in a loop. That's why you pierced two holes in each bat initially! You'll probably want at least 10 inches (25 cm) of string (or dental floss), so the string is easy to grab. This is how you'll manipulate the wings. When you hang your bat up, you can just give the string a tug and away he'll go!\n6. Attach a ribbon and red sequin eyes. Thread the ribbon through the bottom hole to hang the bat upside down from your wall or ledge. Tie it in a loop and knot. Then, make red eyes with sequins. Googly eyes work, too!\n\n\n## Flowerpot pumpkins\n\n1. Purchase a few terra cotta pots. Having a variety of sizes will give you a pumpkin family! Make sure they're clean if you had them laying around the house. You want them very orange to simulate pumpkins.\n2. Cut the parts of a face out of yellow craft paper. If you don't have craft paper, use scrapbook paper, card, or wrapping paper. Anything that's bendy and colorful will work. Make arched evil eyebrows, a handlebar mustache, surprised eyes, or any detail that you'd like your pumpkin pots to have. The simpler your face, the more it will look like a jack-o-lantern. Give it a toothy grin, a triangular nose, and triangular eyes to make it look more pumpkin-esque.\n3. Brush the surface of the pot with outdoor modge-podge. You only need a layer on the side you'll place the face for right now. Use a sponge brush or paint brush for best results. A thin, but even layer is ideal.\n4. Apply the pieces of the face to the upside down pot. Press them firmly into place. Then, apply a thin layer of the sticky stuff all over the pot, effectively weather-proofing it.\n5. Insert a stick into the end for a stem. When we say stick, we mean stick. Go outside under a tree and find a stick to fit through the bottom of your terra cotta pot. And there it is -- a pumpkin that won't rot in a week's time!\n\n\n## Giant spooky spiders\n\n1. Cut off the spout of an empty, clean milk jug. Just below the lid is what you don't want. Use a craft knife to make this easy -- scissors will be difficult to work with. Make sure your milk jug is clean! If there's still a milky residue it may end up smelling.\n2. Cover the jug with black tape. This will form the body of your spider. Go as tightly around the handle as you can; but don't worry -- if it's still discernible, that's fine.\n3. Get 4 6-foot (2 m) black foam pipe insulation tubes that are 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter. These will be the legs. Tape each one in the center along the handle of the jug. Then, tape the tubes along the sides of the jug too, to make it look as if the legs are going along the body. The tubes will bend into place.\n4. Cut a slit at a joint in the legs. If you cut a slit in the tube, it will bend at your cut. If you hold it in the bend, you can tape it to stay permanently bent. This will form the joints in your spiders legs. A 1\" (2.5 cm) triangle cut is good -- the tube won't unexpectedly break off. Just hold it at its bending point and wrap tape around the newly-formed joint.\n5. Use two halves of a plastic Easter egg for eyes. They'll bulge out and be adequately creepy -- especially if you cut a slit of black tape for pupils. If you don't have an egg lying around, puff balls (or anything circular, really) work as well. Just attach them to the jug with more tape or glue.\n\n\n## Adorable hanging ghosts\n\n1. Create your ghost form with two small paper cups. Turn the first one upside down, then place the second one on top of that. To make it stable, tape or glue the bottoms together. You won't actually be using the cups as part of the ghost -- it's just used for sizing in the initial stages. So if you don't want to fuss with tape, don't worry about it!\n2. Inflate a small balloon and put it in the top cup. But not too much! If it's too big it won't fit in the cup. Make it so it fills out the cup, like a round poof of whipped cream tops a mug of hot chocolate.\n3. Soak pieces of cheesecloth in fabric stiffener. You'll want to work with pieces that are about 8 inches (20 cm) square. Grab a bowl and fill it with fabric stiffener, soaking each piece thoroughly. About 10 seconds per piece will do the job nicely.\n4. Immediately drape over the balloon. After you've soaked a piece, drape it over the balloon and move onto the next piece. Center the pieces, evenly draped over the balloon, but not perfectly uniform. Once you've finished with all your pieces, let it dry for about ten minutes. It will then harden and take shape.\n5. Pop the balloon! This will require a needle or other pointy object since you can't go smashing your creation on the floor (well, you could, if you get really frustrated -- but that'd defeat the purpose). After you do so, you should be left with a free-floating white ghost-like creation. Isn't Halloween the best?\n6. Remove from the cup and rough up the edges. The ends should look tattered, as if they're wafting in some sort of unregisterable-to-humans breeze. Just bending them with your fingers should do the trick.\n7. Attach felt eyes and fishing line to hang. Little tiny black dots for eyes are all these little guys need to be cute and not at all ominous. Black sequins or beads can work, too. As for the fishing line, just thread it through the cheesecloth, loop, and tie in a knot! Hang your new buddies from lights, shelves, windows, or the ceiling.\n\n\n## Eyes in a bush\n\n1. Get an empty toilet paper roll, and a glowstick. You can easily find both at a dollar store.\n2. Cut out two football shaped eye holes. Place them about two to three inches (5 to 7.5cm) apart.\n3. Put the glowsticks in the center of the toilet paper roll. Do not cause them to glow until they need to be used as a decoration on the night of Halloween.\n4. Put the roll(s) in your bushes/trees. When you cause the glowsticks tot work, you will have scary eyes in a bush!\n\n\n## Paper bag ghosts\n\n1. Obtain rubber bands and a white paper bag.\n2. Draw a ghost face on the paper bag.\n3. Put the rubber band around the middle of the bag.\n4. Decorate. Add the face of a ghost and any other designs.\n5. Hang up from the ceiling, on branches, etc.\n\n\n## Scary halloween candy bowl\n\n1. Get a fake hand, a bowl, glue, and candy. The glue must be non-toxic as food is going to come into contact with it.\n2. Glue the fake hand onto the bottom of the bowl.\n3. Let the glue dry for about two to three hours.\n4. Fill the bowl with candy.\n5. Set the bowl out for the trick or treaters.\n",
