    "generated_instruction": "What can you do with powdered peanut butter?",
    "original_question": "How to boost your diet with peanut butter powder?",
    "response": "Powdered peanut butter is a versatile ingredient that you can use to add some nutty flavor to any dish. Its low caloric count and limited fat content make it an appealing option for those looking to lose a little weight. It is great for supplementing simple dishes like smoothies or oatmeal. You can also use it to make savory sauces, spreads, or peanut-flavored dishes. Finally, you can mix the powder into any baked good, from brownies to cupcakes and cookies, to add some peanut flavor.\n\n## Enhance your diet\n\n1. Reduce your caloric intake. The main appeal of peanut butter powder is its low calorie count. A tablespoon of powdered peanut butter has about 25 calories compared to the 96 calories in the same amount of regular peanut butter. It is a good option for those looking to lose some weight but still enjoy peanut flavor.\n2. Limit your fat intake. Another appealing feature of powdered peanut butter is its low fat content. 1 tablespoon contains less than 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fat, while the same amount of regular peanut butter has about 8 grams (0.3 oz) of fat. Note that the fat content of peanuts is mostly heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. A single serving of peanut butter powder is 2 tablespoons. One serving contains about 1.5 grams of fat.\n3. Add a little protein or fiber. Powdered peanut butter is great for adding protein and fiber nutrients without adding the extra fat — 1 tablespoon offers 3 to 4 grams (0.11 to 0.14 oz) of protein and 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fiber. This is particularly important for things like baking where the extra fat can alter the finished product.\n\n\n## Supplement simple dish\n\n1. Add it to your smoothies. To add peanut flavor while limiting calories and fat, you can add a tablespoon or two of the powder to your favorite smoothie. For most recipes, about 2 tablespoons (12.28 g) of powder can substitute for 1 tablespoon (16 g) of traditional peanut butter. Besides its lower calorie count, powdered peanut butter also makes your smoothies smoother and less gritty. As a rule of thumb, add 1 tablespoon (6.14 g) of powdered peanut butter for every 1 cup (250 ml) of smoothie or shake\n2. Mix it into your oatmeal. Instead of adding a regular peanut butter, mix in a spoonful of powdered peanut butter to your bowl of oatmeal. You can stir it with the oats before you add your milk or water, or you can mix it in after your oats are cooked. Pair it with a banana, some dark chocolate, or some berries for a PB&J oatmeal. You can also add peanut butter powder to muesli, quinoa, and other grain-based dishes.\n3. Pour some into your yogurt or granola. If you are making a parfait, you can mix powdered peanut butter into the either the granola or the yogurt. To add some extra flavor to your yogurt, mix in a spoonful of the powder. You can also sprinkle on top of the granola. If you are making your own granola, you can mix in powdered peanut butter for some additional flavor.\n\n\n## Cook with peanut butter powder\n\n1. Use it to make a peanut sauce. You can add powdered peanut butter to any sauce recipe that calls for peanut butter. Simply rehydrate the powder by mixing it with water and then add it to your sauce. Be sure to follow the directions to get the correct amount of peanut powder for the sauce. As a rule of thumb, mixing 4 tablespoons (24.56 g) of peanut butter powder with 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) of water will give you 2 tablespoons (32 g) of rehydrated peanut butter.\n2. Add it to breading. To add some extra flavor to your breaded meats, try mixing some powdered peanut butter into your breading. Use your traditional breading recipe and simply mix in about 1/3 as much peanut butter powder as flour our breadcrumbs. You could try this breading on chicken cutlets or pork chops. Consider adding crushed red pepper flakes to the breading for a little extra spice.\n3. Get creative. You can use powdered peanut butter to add some extra flavor to snacks like popcorn or trail mixes. You can also sprinkle it on top of bananas, mix it with your cereal, or add it to pancake batter. If you think that a dish might benefit from some peanut flavor, give it a dash of powdered peanut butter. For example, with a little olive oil and a couple spoonfuls of powdered peanut butter, you can make peanut butter popcorn. For a sweeter treat, consider sprinkling peanut butter powder on top of kettle corn.\n\n\n## Add peanut butter powder to desserts\n\n1. Bake it into baked goods. If you want to give your desserts a little extra peanut flavor, consider adding some peanut butter powder. You can add it to any baked good by substituting peanut butter powder for 1/3 the amount of flour called for in the recipe. In addition, you can mix in a couple of tablespoons of the powder to any batter. If a recipe calls for 3 cups (375 g) of flour, use 1 cup (294.7 grams) of peanut butter powder and 2 cups (250 g) of flour. If you are making banana muffins, you might add 3 tablespoons (18.42 g) of peanut butter powder to the batter.\n2. Go gluten-free. If you have a gluten intolerance or suffer from celiac disease, you can use peanut butter powder to make a number of desserts that do not require flour. You can make gluten free peanut butter brownies. You can also make gluten-free peanut butter cookies in a matter of minutes.\n3. Make a peanut butter spread. You can make a peanut butter spread in no time using a little peanut butter powder and cream cheese. Simply mix 1 tablespoon (6.14 g) of powder with an 8-ounce (226.8 g) block of cream cheese. If the spread does not have the peanut flavor you want, add sprinkles of the powder and mix until it tastes the way you would like.\n",

Before jQuery 1.6, the ```.attr()``` method sometimes\ntook property values into account when retrieving some attributes,\nwhich could cause inconsistent behavior. As of jQuery 1.6, the ```.prop()```\nmethod provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while\n```.attr()``` retrieves attributes.&quot;\n&quot;Properties generally affect the dynamic state of a DOM element without\nchanging the serialized HTML attribute. Examples include the ```value```\nproperty of input elements, the ```disabled``` property of inputs and\nbuttons, or the ```checked``` property of a checkbox. The ```.prop()``` method\nshould be used to set ```disabled``` and ```checked``` instead of the ```.attr()```\nmethod. The ```.val()``` method should be used for getting and setting\n```value```.&quot; - jQuery documentation for prop()\n\nPre-jQuery 3.0 (before 2016)\nThe reason why you should use ```prop``` over ```removeAttr()``` is that ```removeAttr()``` completely removes the ```disabled``` attribute itself - as this method would simply set the corresponding property name to ```false```:\n\nPrior to jQuery 3.0, using .removeAttr() on a boolean attribute such\nas checked, selected, or readonly would also set the corresponding\nnamed property to false. This behavior was required for ancient\nversions of Internet Explorer but is not correct for modern browsers\nbecause the attribute represents the initial value and the property\nrepresents the current (dynamic) value. - jQuery 3.0 Breaking Changes\n\nWhile ```prop()``` merely sets the property's underlying boolean value to false.",

    "original_question": "I understand that unlocking the bootloader will wipe my Android phone, but have been looking around for why.  Seems to be by design, but what is the reasoning for that design?  Is it some security concern, some obscure technical reason, or just for lulz?  I'm looking for something solid to chew on here, something more than because \"that's how it is\".",
    "response": "It's a security concern. The Android documentation doesn't provide a lot of elaboration, stating simply:\n\n  The procedure must be confirmed on-screen, and deletes the user data for privacy reasons.\n\nHowever, the privacy concern is relatively straightforward to extrapolate. Once the bootloader is unlocked, the device can be flashed with unsigned images. This means that it is relatively trivial to root the device, and there are actually multiple ways it can be done, such as:\n\n* Flashing a system image with root tools built in\n* Flashing a boot image that runs ```adbd``` with root by default (an \"unsecure\" image)\n* Flashing a recovery image, then using that to overwrite the system or boot partitions with ones that allow root access\n\nOnce root is obtained, all of the information on ```/data``` essentially becomes accessible. This could be emails, contact information, or many other pieces of personal information that you likely don't want in the wrong hands. \n\nTherefore, it makes sense to wipe all of this data during the unlocking procedure to ensure that there is no off-the-shelf \"official\" way of bypassing the sandboxing restrictions implemented by the Android operating system, which would thereby allow someone to steal personal data.\n\nOf course, there may be ways to root without wiping on some devices, but they rely on exploits rather than official methods like a bootloader unlock, meaning they are basically bugs.",

    "original_question": "Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20°C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20°C (-4°F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.",
    "response": "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter.",

    "response": "In few words, rooting an Android system means overcome the limitations that were imposed over it by the manufacturer. People may want that for different reasons, but the main one is freedom. Having a rooted phone means you've got all the control over your device.\n\nThe main reason people root phones is to install a custom ROM. Custom ROMs are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer ROMs, like installing apps on sdcard or taking screenshots. Custom ROMS can also become a system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers. You can see a review of popular ROMS, as an example, here.\n\nRooting Android also allows you to uninstall stock apps that you don't use or don't want, besides those that violates user's privacy (see CarrierIQ). Another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage. A rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access. Those apps generally aim to do something that would not be possible without that privilege.

    "response": "Many people love the TV show \"What Not to Wear\", so it would obviously make a great party idea for them! Here's a guide on how to make your What Not to Wear party one to remember!\n\n## Step\n\n1. You can do this party one of two ways: Make it just like the show, and invite one of your friends/family members that makes fashion faux-pas a little too often, then surprise them by saying they they're going to get a fashion makeover! This is a great idea for a surprise birthday party, because then all the guests could get the birthday person fashionable clothes or gift cards to cool stores. Tell all your guests to wear their most horrible outfits. Floor-length skirts, see-through shirts, unmatched colours and patterns, old lady dresses, nurse's shoes, and bad makeup. Also, tell them to bring their favourite/most fashionable outfits. This is a good theme for younger kids/teenagers because it gets the guests more involved. If you want, you can mix components of both parties.\n2. For both parties, assign your own family/friends to be the cast of \"What not to Wear\". If possible, get a man and a woman and assign them as the hosts (Clinton Kelly and Stacy London), then a woman to be the makeup artist (Carmine), and possibly even a man to be the hairstylist (Ted Gibson). However, it's not recommended to have your hairstylist actually cut anyone's hair. Instead, have them braid their hair, or curl, crimp, or straighten it.\n3. For both parties, decorate your house/party space just like the \"What not to Wear\" studio. Make sure to have a place for your guests to get their makeup done by your very own Carmine. Place pictures of fashionable outfits around your house as well.\n4. At the end of either party theme, eat cake/snacks, chat, dance, or do whatever you please now that everyone looks great, and you can go to bed knowing that you had a great party!\n\n\n## \"what not to wear\" replica theme\n\n1. When you send out invitations to your guests, tell them to send you pictures of your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (the FF-PP) wearing their worst outfits.\n2. Once the party starts, sit your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (FF-PP) down, and tell them that you've been secretly filming them for the past 2 weeks (or however long you want). Then show them the pictures that your friends/family sent in of them. Then tell them that they're going to get a huge makeover!\n3. Go through your FF-PP's outfits and 'throw them away' (You don't have to if you don't want to).\n4. Instead of going shopping for new outfits like they do on the show, open your guests' presents (if they've gotten the birthday person clothes and gift cards). That will be their new wardrobe.\n5. Give your FF-PP a makeover! Do their makeup, nails, and hair.\n6. Reveal your made-over FF-PP to your guests.\n\n\n## Worst-dressed to best-dressed theme\n\n1. Send out invitations with the 'What not to Wear' logo on them, as well as pictures of Clinton Kelly and Stacy London, the hosts of the show. You can also have pictures of horrible outfits and put big red 'X's over them.\n2. Once everyone has arrived at the party, award your 'Worst-dressed Person' with a prize (something fashion-related, such as a pair of cute earrings).\n3. Have a 'worst-dressed' photo shoot. This is a lot of fun.\n4. Have 'Stacy' and 'Clinton' critique everyone's outfits, just like on the show.\n5. Tell your guests to get dressed in their favourite/most fashionable outfits. If somebody forgets theirs, lend them one of your chic outfits!\n6. After your guests are all dressed up, it's time for a makeover! Have some makeup on-hand, as well as some nail polish for manicures. Also, give them to option of curling, straightening, and/or crimping their hair.\n7. After everyone's makeovers are finished, announce the \"Best-Dressed Award\". Give them a prize similar to the winner of the \"Worst-Dressed Award\".\n8. Once the \"Best-Dressed Award\" has been handed out, it's time for a photo shoot! Take pictures of your guests in their best outfits.\n9. Have your guests be revealed to 'Stacy' and 'Clinton'. Make sure that Stacy and Clinton both say positive stuff about the guest's outfits. Make sure that the person playing Stacy London says \"Shut up!\" frequently (she says \"Shut up!\" whenever she's impressed with an outfit).\n10. Reveal your pictures of your guests in their worst outfits (Before) and their best outfits (after). This will be a lot of fun and will get a lot of laughs.\n",

    "response": "Python provides two ways to sort a list, the built-in list method `list.sort()` and the built-in function `sorted()`.\n\nThe primary difference between the two is that list.sort() will sort the list in-place, mutating its indexes and returning None, whereas sorted() will return a new sorted list leaving the original list unchanged. Another difference is that sorted() accepts any iterable while list.sort() is a method of the list class and can only be used with lists. \n\nHere is an example of using `list.sort()`:\n\n```\n# the list to be sorted\nx = [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 4, 8]\n\n# sort by list.sort()\nx.sort()\nprint(x)\n```\n\nThe output of the above code is \n```\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\nEquivalently, you can use `sorted()`:\n\n```\nsorted_x = sorted(x)\n```",

    "generated_instruction": "How can I drive more economically no matter where I’m going?",
    "original_question": "How to drive economically?",
    "response": "Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car’s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you’re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you’ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don’t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you’re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It’s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car’s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren’t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car’s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you’re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner’s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won’t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you’re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You’ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start “cold” less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n",

    "response": "The difference between ```--save``` and ```--save-dev``` may not be immediately noticeable if you have tried them both on your own projects.

    "generated_instruction": "Why are function prototypes in C language written in this way\n``` int f(a, b); ```",
    "original_question": "In general, there are two types of syntax of defining functions - Something like C, C++, C#, or Java (```int functionName(char arg)```) vs the ML (and others) tradition of defining the return type after the function (and using something like a ```fun``` keyword to define a function - like ```fun functionName(char arg): int```).\nOne of the advantages (for the parser, at least) for a ```fun``` keyword is that it lets the parser be context-free (it doesn't have to guess if ```int``` defines a variable or if it defines a function).\nWhen C was invented, computers had very little memory and speed (so little, that the reason C requires one to define all the variables in the beginning of the function was because it had to be a one-pass parser). Why didn't they choose the simple way out and use function defining keyword?",
    "response": "Dennis Ritchie’s paper on The Development of the C Language gives some idea of the reasoning behind this: namely, the fundamental rule in C that declaration syntax should match expression syntax\"\n\nFor each object of such a composed type, there was already a way to mention the underlying object: index the array, call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer. Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear. Thus,\n```int i, *pi, **ppi;\n```\ndeclare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a pointer to an integer. The syntax of these declarations reflects the observation that ```i```, ```*pi```, and ```**ppi``` all yield an ```int``` type when used in an expression. Similarly,\n```int f(), *f(), (*f)();\n```\ndeclare a function returning an integer, a function returning a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning an integer;\n```int *api[10], (*pai)[10];\n```\ndeclare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to an array of integers. In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of the declaration.\n\n\nIt appears this rule trumped parser considerations. Its immediate consequence is that function declarations can’t use specific keywords, or impose a different ordering of declaration components.\nIt’s worth noting that parsing was somewhat different in early C, since function declarations didn’t specify their arguments, and function definitions separated the argument list from the argument declarations (which weren’t necessary for ```int``` arguments):\n```sum();\n```\ndeclares a ```sum``` function, which would then be defined as\n```sum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n(no types needed here, the default is ```int```). So the parser didn’t deal with types inside argument lists.",

You can also press ⊞ Win+E to open the File Explorer.\n2. Go to the folder in which you want to create the file. On the left side of the File Explorer window, click the folder in which you want to make your computer file.\n3. Click the Home tab. It's in the top-left side of the File Explorer window. A toolbar will drop down from the top of the File Explorer window. You can also just right-click a blank space in the window to prompt a drop-down menu.\n4. Click New item. This is in the \"New\" section of the toolbar. A drop-down menu will appear. If you're using the right-click menu, select New in the drop-down menu to prompt a pop-out menu.\n5. Select a file type. In the drop-down menu, click the type of file you want to create. Doing so will prompt the file to appear in your selected folder with its name highlighted. If the file type you want to create isn't listed in the menu, see the final method for details on creating a file from within a program.\n6. Enter a name for the file. While the file's name is highlighted, type in whatever you want to name the file.\n7. Press ↵ Enter. Doing so saves your file's name and creates the file in your selected location. You can double-click the file to open it.\n\n\n## On mac\n\n1. Understand the types of files you can create. Unlike Windows computers, Macs don't allow you to create new files without opening the program with which you want to create a file (this means that if you want to create a Microsoft Word document, for example, you must open Microsoft Word). However, you can still create folders. If you want to create a file or document, see the final method.\n2. Open Finder. Click the Finder app icon, which resembles a blue face, in the Dock.\n3. Go to the folder in which you want to create the folder. In the Finder window, go to the folder where you want to create a new folder. For example, to create a new folder in the \"Downloads\" folder, you would click Downloads on the left side of the Finder window.\n4. Click File. It's on the left side of the menu bar that's at the top of your Mac's screen. A drop-down menu will appear.\n5. Click New Folder. This option is in the drop-down menu. Doing so adds a new folder to the current location.\n6. Enter a name. While the folder's name is highlighted (as it will be immediately after you create it), type in the name that you want to use for the folder.\n7. Press ⏎ Return. Doing so will save your folder name and create the folder in your current folder location.\n\n\n## Use program menus\n\n1. Open the program you want to use. Click or double-click the app icon for the program that you want to use to create a file, or do one of the following to search for the program:\n\t* \n\t* Windows — Click Start , type in the name of the program you want to open, and click the program at the top of the search results. Mac — Click Spotlight , type in the name of the program you want to open, and double-click the program at the top of the search results.\n2. Click File. It's typically in the upper-left side of the program window (Windows) or the screen (Mac). A drop-down menu will appear. Some programs, such as Paint 3D on Windows computers, will have a New or New Project on the opening page of the program. If so, skip this step.\n3. Click the New option. This option is usually found in the File drop-down menu, but you may find it on the launch page for the program as well. Some programs, such as Adobe CC, may require you to enter details about the project or select a template before proceeding.\n4. Create your file as needed. If you want to do anything to your file (e.g., add text) before saving it, do so before proceeding.\n5. Open the \"Save As\" menu. The easiest way to do this on any computer is by pressing either Ctrl+S (Windows) or ⌘ Command+S (Mac). You can also click File and then click Save As. If pressing Ctrl+S or ⌘ Command+S doesn't do anything, it's probably because you already created your file during the New process. This is common for Adobe CC programs.\n6. Enter a name for your file. In the \"File name\" (Windows) or \"Name\" (Mac) text box in the Save As window, type in the name you want to use to identify your file.\n7. Select a save location. Click one of the folders on the left side of the window to select it as the location in which you'll save your file. For example, to save a file on the desktop, you would click the Desktop folder. On a Mac, you may instead need to click the \"Where\" drop-down box and then click the folder in which you want to save the file in the resulting drop-down menu.\n8. Click Save.

    "generated_instruction": "I'd like you to show me the best recipe to freeze and thaw homemade lasagna at the best.",
    "original_question": "How to freeze lasagna?",
    "response": "Freezing homemade lasagna is a great way to have ready-made meals on hand for nights when it's all you can do to turn the oven on and heat up dinner. When you make lasagna and freeze it for later, you'll have a homemade, healthy meal on hand whenever you need it. You can freeze lasagna baked or unbaked, but you'll need to thaw it overnight before cooking it to serve. See Step 1 to learn how to freeze lasagna so that it stays fresh-tasting.\n\n## Prepare the lasagna\n\n1. Make a freezer-friendly lasagna recipe. Some ingredients taste better than others when they're reheated after being frozen. Most lasagna recipes that call for fresh ingredients will be just fine after freezing, whether you freeze them unbaked or baked. However, if the recipe uses items that have already been frozen and thawed once, it's best not to freeze and thaw them twice. This increases the chance that the food could be contaminated by bacteria. For example, don't plan on freezing lasagna made with sausage or ground beef that was previously frozen. Instead, use fresh meat or leave it out completely. Food that is frozen and thawed more than once also suffers when it comes to flavor and texture. Choosing a recipe that calls for fresh ingredients will result in the best-tasting lasagna. If your favorite lasagna recipe calls for a frozen ingredient, the final dish usually won't be too affected by substituting the fresh version instead. For example, instead of using frozen mushrooms, just use fresh. In most cases you will have needed to thaw them anyway.\n2. Assemble the lasagna in a dish that can be frozen. Look for a \"freezer-proof\" label or be certain that the dish can be frozen as well as used for baking. Most glass or ceramic casserole dishes are fine for this purpose. Avoid using an aluminum pan for long-term storage of lasagna. The food might end up picking up a tinny taste. If you don't have a dish that can be used to both bake and freeze lasagna, you can bake it one dish and freeze it in a freezer-safe food storage container.\n3. Decide whether to bake it first. Lasagna that has been baked before freezing will still taste great after it has been reheated. Lasagna that has been assembled and frozen before baking is delicious, too. Use whichever method is most convenient for you, since the final texture and taste of the dish won't be too affected either way. You might decide to freeze pre-baked lasagna if you have leftovers after making a big batch. If you'd rather freeze it before baking, consider making two lasagnas next time you're having lasagna for dinner. You can bake one and freeze the other to eat later.\n4. Bring the lasagna to room temperature. If you want to freeze baked lasagna, it's necessary to make sure it has cooled entirely before you freeze it. Otherwise, the texture of the dish won't be as pleasant when it's time to eat it. After making the lasagna, set it aside for one hour to cool. You can also place it into the refrigerator to chill. Before placing it in the fridge, cover the lasagna with two layers of plastic wrap and one layer of kitchen foil.\n5. Cover the lasagna with freezer-safe plastic wrap. Don't use aluminum foil, since it might affect the taste of the lasagna. Cover it with several layers of plastic wrap to keep it fresh in the freezer. You may want to wrap the plastic around the entire dish, rather than just over the top. That way, you can make sure there are no gaps in the wrap where air could get in and cause freezer burn. Consider cutting the lasagna into individual portions and freezing them in bags. This way you won't have to reheat the entire thing if you only need a meal for one or two people. Cut the lasagna into serving sized-portions after it has chilled. This will help the pieces hold together better instead of falling apart. Put each piece in its own freezer-safe storage bag. No matter what, make sure it is double wrapped to prevent the lasagna from drying out.\n6. Freeze the lasagna. Label it and place it in the freezer. It can be frozen for up to three months, whether it has a meat or vegetable filling.\n\n\n## Thaw and reheat lasagna\n\n1. Thaw it overnight. The night before you intend to have the lasagna for dinner, thaw it overnight. If you try to bake it while it's still partially frozen, it will cook unevenly and the taste and texture will be affected. It will also be more difficult to determine whether it's done or not. You can thaw either the entire lasagna or portions in the refrigerator overnight.\n2. Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF. This is the standard cooking temperature for lasagna. No matter what recipe you used, this is a good temperature for baking your lasagna to perfection.\n3. Ready the lasagna for baking. Unwrap all of the plastic wrap, and cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. This will keep the top from getting too brown while the rest of the lasagna cooks. If you're cooking an individual portion of lasagna, take the piece you want to bake out of its storage bag and place it on a suitable baking dish, then cover with foil.\n4. Bake the lasagna. Put it in the oven and cook it half an hour to 40 minutes, or until heated through. You may need to test a small piece from the center to make sure it isn't still cold in the middle. During the last 10 minutes of baking, you can remove the foil to allow the heat to reach the top if you want a brown, crispy crust on your lasagna. If you're just reheating an individual piece of lasagna, you can do it in the microwave instead of in the oven. Place it on a microwave-safe dish and microwave on high for 2 - 3 minutes, or until it's hot and bubbly. Do not use aluminum foil in the microwave.\n5. Serve the lasagna. Since it has been in the freezer for awhile, you might want to freshen it up by sprinkling some chipped basil or oregano on top.\n",

    "response": "The syntax you tried is actually ambiguous. Depending on how many days are in the month, some months it will run on odd days and some on even. This is because the way it is calculated takes the total number of possibilities and divides them up. You can override this strage-ish behavior by manually specifying the day range and using either an odd or even number of days. Since even day scripts would never run on the 31st day of longer months, you don't lose anything using 30 days as the base for even-days, and by specifying specifically to divide it up as if there were 31 days you can force odd-day execution.\n\nThe syntax would look like this:\n```# Will only run on odd days:\n0 0 1-31/2 * * command\n# Will only run on even days:\n0 0 2-30/2 * * command\n```\n\nYour concern about months not having the same number of days is not important here because no months have MORE days than this, and for poor February, the date range just won't ever match the last day or two, but it will do no harm having it listed.\n\nThe only 'gotcha' for this approach is that if you are on an odd day cycle, following months with 31 days your command will also run on the first of the month. Likewise if you are forcing an even cycle, each leap year will cause one three-day cycle at the end of February. You cannot really get around the fact that any regular pattern of \"every other day\" is not always going to fall on even or odd days in every month and any way you force this you will either have an extra run or be missing a run between months with mismatched day counts.",

    "generated_instruction": "I am trying to cut carbon arrows for my bow. The arrows are too long, and I do not have the correct length. What is the best way to get the correct length for carbon arrows for my bow?",
    "original_question": "How to cut carbon arrows?",
    "response": "Carbon arrows are a lightweight alternative to aluminum, but they may not always come in the correct length you need. While you can always take the arrows into a hunting store to have them cut by a professional, you can also cut arrows at home with a rotary cutter or an arrow saw. Before you cut the arrows, be sure to measure your draw length to know how long the shafts need to be. When you’re finished, your arrows will be the perfect size!\n\n## Find the proper arrow length\n\n1. Hold a tape measure out to your side with your non-dominant hand. Grip the tape measure in your nondominant hand so the tape points toward your wrist. Fully extend your nondominant arm out to your side so it’s parallel to the ground to simulate holding a bow. Make sure you can easily grab and pull the tape toward you, and reposition the tape measure in your hand if you can’t. Avoid using a fabric tape measure since it may give you an inaccurate measurement.\n2. Pull the tape to the corner of your mouth with your dominant hand. Grab the end of the tape with your dominant hand and slowly pull it out. Keep pulling the tape until the end touches the corner of your mouth on the dominant side of your body. For example, pull it to the right corner of your mouth if you’re right-handed. Once the tape measure is fully extended, look at the measurement. Pulling the tape measure to the corner of your mouth simulates drawing a bowstring so you can get an accurate measurement for your draw length.Tip: Put your nondominant thumb on the tape measure before checking the measurement so it doesn’t retract. Otherwise, you’ll have to measure again.\n3. Add 2 in (5.1 cm) to your measurement to find the arrow length. If your arrow is too short, it could jam your bow or cause the arrow to shoot improperly. Take the draw length measurement you just found and include an extra 2 inches (5.1 cm) to ensure that the arrows are long enough for your bow. For example, if your draw length measurement was 29 inches (74 cm), then the length of your arrow should be 31 inches (79 cm).\n4. Transfer your measurement onto the arrow shaft. Start your measuring tape at the back of the arrow shaft and extend the tape toward the front. When you reach the measurement you found, use a marker to draw a line or dot on the arrow shaft so you know where to cut. Rotate the arrow 180 degrees and make another mark in the same place to use as reference. Don’t include the arrow’s nock in the measurement since nock sizes vary between arrows. Start at the base of the arrow shaft instead.\n\n\n## Use a rotary cutter\n\n1. Clamp a rotary cutter horizontally over the edge of the table. A rotary cutter is a handheld multitool that spins quickly to cut through materials. Use a rotary cutter with a circular carbide blade so it can easily cut through the carbon arrows without deforming them. Lay the rotary cutter horizontally so the blade is vertical and hangs over the edge of your work surface. Use a C-clamp to secure the tool to your work surface so it doesn’t shift around while you’re using it. You can buy a rotary cutter from your local hardware store.Tip: Make sure you can easily access the power switch on the tool so you can turn it on and off when you need it.\n2. Position the hose of a shop vacuum behind the rotary blade. Cutting carbon arrows creates dust that can cause irritation if you breathe it in, so it’s easiest to vacuum it immediately to prevent it from spreading. Set the end of the hose on your work surface so it’s directly behind the rotary cutter’s blade. Connect the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can also use your regular vacuum if you don’t have a shop vacuum available.\n3. Put on safety glasses and a face mask before turning the machines on. Carbon dust can cause irritation if it gets in your eyes or lungs, so it’s important to stay protected while you work. Put on safety glasses that cover your eyes completely, and a face mask that guards your nose and mouth. Once you put on your safety equipment, you can start the rotary tool and the vacuum. Even though you have a vacuum capturing most of the dust, there still may be particles floating around.\n4. Cut the arrow along the mark you made. Once your rotary tool is spinning at full speed, carefully guide the arrow so the blade lines up with the marks you made earlier. Push the shaft gently against the blade so it cuts into the carbon. Continue pushing the arrow into the blade until it cuts completely through the other side. If the blade has difficulty cutting the arrow straight through, try rotating the arrow while you hold it against the blade to make it easier.\n\n\n## Cut shaft with an arrow saw\n\n1. Attach a shop vacuum hose to the port on the back of an arrow saw. Many arrow saws have a port on the back where you can attach a vacuum hose to collect dust. Push the end of a shop vacuum hose into the dust collection port on the arrow saw until it’s secured in place. Attach the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can buy arrow saws from hunting supply stores or you can order them online. Arrow saws usually cost around $130 USD. You can use your regular vacuum if you don’t have access to a shop vacuum.Tip: If your arrow saw doesn’t have a port for a vacuum hose, then set the hose as close to the blade as you can.\n2. Wear safety glasses and a face mask while you’re cutting arrows. Carbon arrows create carbon fiber dust when you cut them, which can be irritating if you inhale it or if it gets in your eyes. Wear safety glasses that cover your eyes completely and put on a face mask to protect your mouth and nose. Once you have the face mask and safety glasses on, you can turn on your machines.\n3. Position the arrow on the saw so the back sits inside of the notch on the support. Your arrow saw will have a support with a notch on it so your arrow doesn’t roll around while you’re cutting it. Set the back of the arrow in the notch and line up the front of the arrow so the mark you made on the shaft lines up with the saw blade. Your arrow saw may have multiple supports on it. If so, make sure the arrow sits in all of the notches to ensure you make a straight cut.\n4. Rotate the arrow while it’s against the saw blade to cut completely through it. Once your arrow saw is running at full speed, slowly push the arrow shaft into the blade. Once it starts cutting into the arrow, spin the arrow so the blade cuts around the circumference of the shaft. As soon as you around the circumference of the arrow, the end will fall off and you can turn off your saw. Your arrow saw may be powerful enough to cut through the shaft without rotating it.\n",

    "response": "Anycast is networking technique where the same IP prefix is advertised from multiple locations. The network then decides which location to route a user request to, based on routing protocol costs and possibly the 'health' of the advertising servers.\n\nThere are several benefits to anycast. First, in steady state, users of an anycast service (DNS is an excellent example) will always connect to the 'closest' (from a routing protocol perspective) DNS server. This reduces latency, as well as providing a level of load-balancing (assuming that your consumers are evenly distributed around your network).\nAnother advantage is ease of configuration management. Rather than having to configure different DNS servers depending on where a server/workstation is deployed (Asia, America, Europe), you have one IP address that is configured in every location.\n\nDepending on how anycast is implemented, it can also provide a level of high availability. If the advertisement of the anycast route is conditional on some sort of health check (e.g. a DNS query for a well known domain, in this example), then as soon as a server fails its route can be removed. Once the network reconverges, user requests will be seamlessly forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS, without the need for any manual intervention or reconfiguration.\n\nA final advantage is that of horizontal scaling; if you find that one server is being overly loaded, simply deploy another one in a location that would allow it to take some proportion of the overloaded server's requests. Again, as no client configuration is required, this can be done very quickly.",

    "response": "It's not clear to me that Democrats are opposed to border-wall construction (your one source suggests they are fine with border walls/fences where necessary), so much as they opposed to some of the plans for full-border walls that have been put forth so far.\nRecently, in response to reports that the spending bill would include funding for a border wall, 5 Democratic senators released a letter voicing concerns over the cost, the effectiveness, and the legal issues of constructing it.\n\nWe are also concerned with reports that there may be an effort to include funding for a very expensive new wall along the southern border with Mexico and a “deportation force.”  According to non-partisan experts, the proposed new border wall could cost as much as $25 million per mile and raises considerable issues that have not been resolved by the Congress or the Department of Homeland Security.  First, many experts believe that such a border wall will not work.  Second, there is real concern that the Administration, put simply, has no plan to build the border wall.  For example, the Administration has not detailed how to 1) use eminent domain and other procedures to acquire land from private landowners and Native American tribes, 2) design the wall, 3) locate the wall, 4) construct the wall, and 5) require Mexico to pay for the wall given the President’s clear and repeated promises that he would force Mexico to do so. Finally, there are objections to the construction of a wall from Democratic and Republican members of Congress that represent border states.  Given these and other concerns, we believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump’s Administration.\n[...]\nSenator Charles Schumer\nSenator Richard Durbin\nSenator Patty Murray\nSenator Debbie Stabenow\nSenator Patrick Leahy\n\nBased on this letter, it appears their main objections to a full border wall are currently the cost-benefit ratio and the legal issues of taking land from Americans to build it on; objections that may not be unique to Democrats.",

    "generated_instruction": "My grandma just passed away. My grandma left my dog to me. What I should do with my dog.",
    "original_question": "How to help an older dog grieve the loss of its owner?",
    "response": "## Comfort the dog\n\n1. Spend extra time with the dog. A dog in mourning may need extra love and attention. Try to increase the amount of time you spend with the dog. You might spend twenty extra minutes in the morning and evening to help give the dog support while they are grieving the death of their owner. During this time, you can:\n\t* Talk to the dog\n\t* Walk the dog\n\t* \n\t* Groom the dog\n\t* \n\t* Go on a car ride\n\t* Visit the dog park\n\t* Pick out a new toy together at the pet store\n\t* Cuddle the dog on the couch or in bed\n\t* Take the dog for a run, if the dog is healthy enough\n\t* Play a game, like fetch or tug-of-war\n2. Pet the dog. Touch increases the bond between dogs and people. Extra cuddling, petting, and brushing can improve the dog’s mood and distract them from the loss of their owner. As you spend time with the dog, rub their belly or scratch their ears. Give them a little extra grooming time each week. This will help you bond and comfort the dog.\n3. Play their favorite games. Playtime can distract the dog from the loss of their owner. The extra exercise can also boost their mood and decrease the likelihood of grief-related health issues. Try to identify the dog’s favorite games or toys, and spend extra time playing with them. Some older dogs may not want to play as much. Each dog is different. If the dog is uninterested in playing, you might try another way of distracting them. You can also give the dog new and interesting toys. Food puzzle toys can help keep the dog busy while you are not home, reducing the dog’s separation anxiety.\n4. Invite company over. The dog may appreciate having people over to spend time with. Invite a few friends over, and see how the dog reacts. If the dog enjoys the company and socializes with the people, you may want to keep it up. If the dog avoids your guests, you should respect their space. Inviting people or dogs that the dog already knows may cheer the dog up. It can also introduce an element of familiarity in their new life. If the people are total strangers to the dog, invite one or two over at a time to see how well the dog handles it.\n\n\n## Monitor the dog’s health\n\n1. Identify physical symptoms of mourning. Dogs mourn differently from humans. While some dogs may not mourn at all, others will become extremely clingy, anxious, or lethargic. Keep an eye out for the following symptoms. If they do not disappear after a few days, you might consider seeking help from a vet or dog behaviorist. Lethargy or lack of energy. Lack of interest in playing\n\t* Loss of appetite\n\t* \n\t* Unsociable behavior\n\t* Increased sleeping\n\t* \n\t* Weight loss\n\t* Decline in physical health\n2. Encourage the dog to eat. It is very common for older dogs to stop eating after the loss of their owner. This can cause other health issues to develop. If the dog seems to have stopped eating, you should try to get the dog to eat. If possible, keep feeding the dog the same food that the old owner fed them. You can also give the dog kibble in a kong-type dog toy or food puzzle. The dog may enjoy trying to get the food out of the toy. Add a little warm chicken broth to the dog’s dry food to make it softer and more enticing. While a few extra treats here and there may not be detrimental to your dog, you should avoid giving the dog too many treats during this period. They may learn that they will be rewarded for whining, and they may not eat their normal food.\n3. Take the dog on walks. Older dogs may not be extremely active to begin with, but they may become more lethargic after the loss of their owner. Such inactivity can lead to further health problems. If the dog is able, take them on a walk at least once or twice a day. Depending on the age and health of the dog, these may be short walks. You can make even short walks more mentally stimulating for the dog by walking in areas with lots of interesting sights, sounds, and smells. For example, you might take your dog to the park, through the woods, or some place with water.\n4. Take the dog to the vet. If the dog continues to mourn for several weeks or if the dog is not eating, you should visit the vet to make sure that the dog is still in good health. The vet can diagnose an underlying medical problem or prescribe medication to help with the dog's anxiety or depression. While at the vet, you might ask:\n\t* \"What medical issues does this dog have? Can any of them be aggravated by the loss of their owner?\" \"The dog seems really depressed. What can I do to help?\" \"The dog has been sleeping a lot since I took them in. Is this because the dog is depressed or is there another issue?\" \"The dog has not been eating since their owner died. What can I do to encourage them to eat?\" If you know which vet the dog's old owner used, you should take them there. The vet can inform you of the dog's medical history.\n\n\n## Provide a happy home\n\n1. Maintain a routine. For the first few days after the owner has died, it is important to maintain the dog’s routine as much as possible. Older dogs tend not to do well with new habits, schedules, or activities, and the owner’s death may have already disrupted their life. Try to feed and walk the dog at the same times as the old owner did. If you can, reach out to people who knew the dog when it was with the old owner, and see if they have an idea of what the dog’s former routine was like. If you do not know what schedule the old owner kept, you can develop a new schedule for the dog. Keep a consistent routine for the first few weeks that the dog joins you. The dog may also prompt you when they expect to be fed or taken outside. If there has been upheaval in the dog’s life since the owner died (for example, if the dog has been passed around by family members or if you adopted the dog from a shelter), setting a routine will be even more important for the dog. Make sure that you stick to the schedule to help the dog ease into their new home life. Be careful not to let the dog fall into bad habits due to grief. For example, if the dog turns up its nose at food, just let the food sit there until the dog is ready to eat it. Don’t “reward” the behavior by making a fuss.\n2. Take care of your own grief. If you knew the old owner, you may be grieving yourself. This is understandable. Do what you have to so that you can grieve in your own, personal way. This will in turn help the dog by providing a loving, happy home for them. Avoid mourning in front of the dog. Dogs are very sensitive to grief, and they may exhibit signs of mourning if they understand that you are grieving. While it is okay to cry a little in front of the dog, you may want to step into another room to mourn privately.\n3. Reinforce positive behavior. During this time, you may notice that the dog is whining, crying, or acting out. While you may want to give the dog a treat during these episodes, you should avoid rewarding them for this behavior. The dog may learn that they will earn treats if they whine. Instead, reward the dog when they are being good, such as when they are quietly resting. For example, you may notice that the dog is sitting outside of your bedroom door at night and whining. Instead of waking up to comfort the dog, go back to sleep. In the morning, you can pet and talk to the dog. If they are well-behaved, give them a treat with their breakfast. Good times to treat the dog are when the dog is resting quietly, when the dog is sitting with you, or right before you leave the house.\n4. Weigh the pros and cons of getting a new dog. While a new dog companion might provide company for the dog, many older dogs do not do well with a new younger dog in the house. While some older dogs may enjoy having a puppy around, others may snap at the younger dog or bully them. Consider carefully whether a new dog is appropriate for the older dog. Also keep in mind that bringing in a new companion for the dog will not make them miss their old owner any less. If a friend or family member has a puppy, ask if they can be introduced to your older dog. This will show you how well the dog deals with energetic puppies. If the older dog plays, cuddles, or gets along with the puppy, you might consider getting a younger dog. Try taking the dog to a dog park when it’s not too crowded, and see if the dog seems to enjoy being around other dogs. If so, then you might consider bringing home a new dog. Another option is to adopt an older or senior dog. Try to find one with a similar temperament. See if the dogs can meet first before you adopt to see if they are friendly with one another.\n",

    "original_question": "What is the significance of 1/1/1753 in SQL Server?",
    "response": "The decision to use 1st January 1753 (```1753-01-01```) as the minimum date value for a datetime in SQL Server goes back to its Sybase origins.\nThe significance of the date itself though can be attributed to this man.\n\nPhilip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield. Who steered the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 through the British Parliament. This legislated for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar for Britain and its then colonies. \n\nThere were some missing days (internet archive link) in the British calendar in 1752 when the adjustment was finally made from the Julian calendar. September 3, 1752 to September 13, 1752 were lost.\nKalen Delaney explained the choice this way\n\n> So, with 12 days lost, how can you compute dates? For example, how can you compute the number of days between October 12, 1492, and July 4, 1776? Do you include those missing 12 days? To avoid having to solve this problem, the original Sybase SQL Server developers decided not to allow dates before 1753. You can store earlier dates by using character fields, but you can't use any datetime functions with the earlier dates that you store in character fields.\n\nThe choice of 1753 does seem somewhat anglocentric however as many catholic countries in Europe had been using the calendar for 170 years before the British implementation (originally delayed due to opposition by the church). Conversely many countries did not reform their calendars until much later, 1918 in Russia. Indeed the October Revolution of 1917 started on 7 November under the Gregorian calendar.\nBoth ```datetime``` and the new ```datetime2``` datatype mentioned in Joe's answer do not attempt to account for these local differences and simply use the Gregorian Calendar.\nSo with the greater range of ```datetime2```\n```SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, DATEADD(DAY,-5,CAST('1752-09-13' AS DATETIME2)),100)\n```\nReturns\n```Sep  8 1752 12:00AM\n```\nOne final point with the ```datetime2``` data type is that it uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar projected backwards to well before it was actually invented so is of limited use in dealing with historic dates.\nThis contrasts with other Software implementations such as the Java Gregorian Calendar class which defaults to following the Julian Calendar for dates until October 4, 1582 then jumping to October 15, 1582 in the new Gregorian calendar. It correctly handles the Julian model of leap year before that date and the Gregorian model after that date. The cutover date may be changed by the caller by calling ```setGregorianChange()```. \nA fairly entertaining article discussing some more peculiarities with the adoption of the calendar can be found here.",

    "original_question": "In Civilization V, you attain a cultural victory by accumulating enough culture to purchase at least 36 social policies, and then building a wonder.

Does it change over time? ",
    "response": "The question you're really asking is &quot;When does the combined culture / turn of an additional city outstrip the increase in social policy cost incurred by founding that city?&quot;\nThe short answer is...\nWe know that adding another city increases the culture costs by approximately 30% of the base cost (that of 1 city). Therefore:\nIf your maximum potential culture / turn won't increase by at least 30% due to the new city, you are hurting, not helping, the time till your next social policy.\n(This may be slightly hard to calculate, and if you take too long to reach your &quot;maximum potential culture / turn&quot; you're actually wasting turns.)\nThe long answer is...\nIt depends\nTo begin with, we need to make some assumptions:\n\n* When you found a new city, you can get its culture / turn maximized within a single turn by buying the necessary building improvements (monument, etc).\n\n* Ignore city-states, leader specific abilities, +culture social policies, and wonders. These all help produce culture, and will shift the &quot;ideal city count&quot; down, but do so inconsistently. To produce an &quot;ideal&quot; city count, we limit ourselves by era and improvements alone.\n\n* This list of social policy costs is accurate for the given parameters: medium map and normal speed.\n\nAnd now, some math.\nThe 1st social policy costs 25 points with a single city. In the ancient era, your cities can generate 2 culture / turn due to the monument. (Remember, we're ignoring the palace for now)\nThis means that it will take 13 turns (Ceiling(25/2) to enact the policy, or 9 turns (ceiling (45/4) with two cities. We can continue this extrapolation -- 8 turns with 3 cities, 7 turns with 4 cities, 6 turns with 5 cities, and we finally reach diminishing returns at city 6 (also 6 turns).\nFor the second social policy, the ramifications of the # of cities gets magnified due to a larger starting value: One city takes 23 turns, two cities take 15 turns, three cities take 13 turns, four cities take 12, five cities take 10, and again, we run into diminishing returns cap out at at six cities (10 turns).\nIt is not until the 4th social policy that this trend is broken and diminishing returns end at the NINTH! city.\nRemember -- this assumes that each city has a monument the minute it is founded.\nNow let's say we've reached the classical age, and have temples in addition to monuments. Each city is now generating 5 culture.\nThe first policy takes 5 turns with a single city, 4 turns with two, and 3 with three.\nWhat (hopefully) becomes clear is that we reached diminishing returns (4 cities as opposed to 6 cities) much faster when each individual city's contribution is higher. The more culture any one city is capable of producing, the more incentive there is to produce more cities. Even if you don't manage to build every +culture improvement immediately, you're still likely to come out ahead (as long as you're pre-diminishing returns).\nSo while the optimal number of cities changes due to any number of factors, you can probably safely not shoot yourself in the foot if you stay between three and six cities, with six being on the high end.",

    "original_question": "I read somewhere that C♯ and D♭ actually differ 41 by cents from each other. As far as I know, there should be 2 semitones between C and D. Moreover, C♯ is one semitone above C and D♭ is one semitone below D. Therefore, C♯ and D♭ should be equivalent. If so, how can C♯ and D♭ actually differ by 41 cents from each other?",
    "response": "When we talk about the exact frequencies of each pitch class, we have to know the temperament, and a reference pitch. For example, 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) with A4=440Hz is a standard in modern music. From those two parameters, we can extrapolate the exact frequency of every possible note.\n\n12TET is nearly ubiquitous nowadays (at least in Western music), but it doesn't sound as clean as Just Intonation (JI). In essence, 12TET has made every key sound equally imperfect. JI creates a scale where the intervals in the primary chords are all very nice simple ratios, and so the chords ring out very cleanly, but it only works in that key. Important note: within a given JI tuning, each of the 12 pitch classes still has only one single frequency. There is no difference between C♯ and D♭ in, say, \"Pythagorean tuning based on A, with A=440Hz\".\n\nBut most music doesn't stay in one key. While a piano can't make pitch adjustments on the fly (which is why we've agreed to use 12TET for it), most instruments in an orchestra can. So when the piece is in A major, the orchestra will use JI and adjust C♯ to be a little flatter than it would be if using 12TET. But then if the piece modulates to F♯ minor, they'll start playing it slightly sharp.\n\nWhen people say that C♯ is not the same as D♭, what they really mean (whether they realize it or not) is that context may make for different micro-adjustments. In C major, a C♯ might be the third of an A major chord, perhaps a secondary dominant of the ii chord, while D♭ might be the root of the Neapolitan chord. These would result in different tuning choices.",

People’s eyes can be very expressive and tell a lot about how they’re feeling toward those around them. Friends will make eye contact with each other during conversation to show interest and respect.

A crush may hold eye contact for a few seconds, and then look away from shyness, and find your gaze again later. Dilated pupils are another indication of a crush. Someone who’s in love with you will feel totally comfortable locking gazes for extended periods of time.\n2. Gauge proximity. The amount of space people choose to place between themselves and others can be an indicator of their perceived relationships with those around them. Someone who is your friend will stand or sit closer to you than an acquaintance. A person with a crush on you will stand near you, lean toward you, and look for reasons to get closer to you- whether it’s intentionally walking past you at a close range, or leaning in closer than necessary to talk to you. People who are in love will stand or sit very close together- perhaps their hips touch when standing side by side or their knees touch when sitting across from one another.\n3. Monitor movement. Our movements, whether conscious or unconscious, can convey lots of different meanings about how we feel about those around us. Friends will tilt their heads while in conversations with other friends to show that they’re listening. They may touch each other in light, casual ways on the hand or arm. Someone with a crush will look for reasons to touch the other person, often in a playful and flirty way. They may seem fidgety or nervous, and may subconsciously begin to copy the movements of their crush. Someone who is in love with you will seem very comfortable and secure around you. They may touch you using gentle, caressing gestures.\n4. Pay attention to posture. The way a person stands (or sits) when they're around you may give you some clues as to how they feel about you. A friend will stand with his or her shoulders and face pointing toward you. If sitting, he or she will uncross his or her legs to show that he or she is open to you. His or her palms may be open toward you as well, another sign of receptivity. When someone has a crush on you, they stand tall and slightly stick their chest out. Additionally, they will point their toes and hips toward you, as a sign of wanting to move toward you (both figuratively and literally).\n\n\n## Listen for verbal cue\n\n1. Recognize vocal tone. The inflection and quality of a person’s voice will change subconsciously depending on the feelings they have toward you. Listen to how someone talks in general, and compare it with they sound when talking to you individually. A friend’s voice will remain constant, with little to no change in pitch or tone. A crush’s voice will have a playful and flirtatious quality to it. Women use a higher pitch to accentuate their femininity. Men use a lower pitch, but alter the pitch, almost to a “sing-song” tone, to both highlight masculinity, and make a woman feel at ease. People who are in love will alter their voices to match their partners’. Men talk in a higher pitch and women a lower one to show that they are connected as one.\n2. Think about how casual your conversations are. A conversation between friends is usually casual and comfortable. Both you and your friend ask and answer questions equally, and may or may not make future plans to hang out.\n3. Notice how much they talk about themselves. If someone has a crush, they will talk a lot about themselves, both from nerves and as a way to “humble-brag.” They will also ask about you, and agree enthusiastically with what you say to make it seem like you have things in common.\n4. Analyze how intimate your conversations are. If someone is in love with you, they will open up to you in intimate ways. You may find out about their deep insecurities and fears, childhood, family dynamics, important personal values, and vision for the future. They may plan future vacations, or invite you to meet family.\n\n\n## Analyze your relationship\n\n1. Reflect on your relationship. Take some time in a quiet place simply to think about your feelings toward the person in question, and your interactions with them. Some questions to consider are:\n\t* How long have you known this person? How frequently do you see or talk to them? Is the communication equitable? What is the level of intimacy shared (either physically or conversationally)? How would you characterize your time together? Do you both seem to enjoy being together?\n2. Make a list. If you’re trying to determine whether someone is a friend or a crush, make a “Friend/Crush” list. If you’re figuring out whether someone is in love with you, make a “Like/Love” list. Like a Pro/Con list, record any specific behavior that would indicate how they feel about you. Having a visual aid way may give you more insight into how they feel.\n3. Ask a trusted friend for help. Sometimes our feelings toward someone can cloud our judgment in assessing their behavior. A friend can offer an honest, objective observation of the relationship, and will be less likely to allow personal feelings to affect their understanding.\n\n\n## Ask directly\n\n1. Express your feelings first. If you’re asking someone to open up to you, then you need to be upfront with them as well. If you’re looking for honesty, you need to show you’re capable of reciprocating. People are more likely to be direct with you if you’re direct with them. Start with a sentence like, \"I want you to know that I feel\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_about you/our relationship. I'm hoping you'll be just as honest and share your feelings about me.\"\n2. Ask in a tactful, non-threatening way. Explain that you’re simply trying to gain some insight and clarity in your relationship, and that you respect their feelings no matter what. It’s important for your partner to know that they can open up to you, without an abrasive reaction. Try saying something like, \"I want you to know that I will completely honor and respect your answer, even if it's not the one I want to hear.\"\n3. Be prepared for the consequences. There’s a chance you and your partner may be on two different wavelengths in terms of your relationship. Their answer may sting a little. Take some time to decide how you want to proceed in the relationship, knowing exactly how your partner feels about you.\n",

Here is an environment that is almost exactly what you're looking for. Assume a new ice age arrives at this time. But it's unlike other ice ages. This time instead of there being all these super-predators and dangerous climate changes and famines and so on, this time, for no reason, the planet just magically decides that the best thing to do is to become an endless expanse of ice in all directions for 100,000 years or so... at the same time. The planet becomes one massive ice desert.\"",

The process can be instantaneous or may take ages, I do not mind which as I need to weigh my options at this stage. \nTo be clear, the devolution I am thinking of is like taking a human being then devolving him/her to the primate stage, so lets say about as far back as Orrorin tugenensis or Paranthropus where they are in the midst of evolving from primates to Homo erectus. Please note I used human beings as an example to give context but the species undergoing devolution may not necessarily be human.\nBased on the answers, \"devolution\" does not exist so had the word in quotes to reflect this. ",
    "response": "Devolution doesn't really ever occur, organisms simply adapt to best suit their environment over time. A good example is cave dwelling Troglodyte type species that have lost the ability to see. They haven't actually devolved to not have eyes, they simply did not need them and evolved to save valuable energy and nutrients by not growing a sight organ that would be useless in their environment. It isn't devolution, it's still evolution since they are changing to better suit their environment. So, at least as far as natural processes go, a species would need to become stuck in an environment for a few hundred thousand years that heavily discourages intellect, sociability, communication skills, culture, and inventiveness. That's a tough one to come up with since such traits are usually the most powerful ones for surviving something.\n\nSo here's the environment and scenario I'm thinking of. Your smart guy race is in the stone age, its pretty much on par with homo sapiens and where they were at about 10,000-15,000 years ago. But something catastrophic doesn't happen. The world slowly becomes a perfect Eden with very few predators, a perfect climate, and vast endless fields of grain and forests of fruit bearing trees. No ice age, no super-predators like we saw in said ice age. No famines or depredation, no rabid competition between several human subspecies for the same resources. The planet (Henceforth known as paradise) is literally perfect. Too perfect. Why would a species that has as close as possible to absolutely nothing to worry about need to even develop the ability to worry? Those big craniums and complex brains waste space and make childbirth more dangerous than necessary. There is absolutely nothing gained by possessing speech, abstract thought, or cooperative culture when all a species needs to do to be successful is to wander around placidly in small familial groups grazing mindlessly on the limitless amounts of food. Shelter is utterly not necessary since you have a perfect climate, nor is clothing, and food is so ludicrously plentiful there is no need to make tools. Within another 100,000 years your species that was formerly well on their way to developing things like agriculture, warfare, and tribal societies has reverted back to dumb grazers that simply live to eat and reproduce.",

    "generated_instruction": "I want a well-formatted list of items to ensure my LinkedIn profile is rock-solid and exemplary",
    "original_question": "How to make your linkedin profile stand out?",
    "response": "LinkedIn has become a key tool for many recruiters to search for qualified candidates and for job seekers to make the right connections when seeking a job. The site allows each person to create a profile that can serve at as an online resume and minimal portfolio. You can make your LinkedIn profile stand out by ensuring that the basics of your profile are rock solid, and then going the extra mile to make it exemplary.\n\n## Start with the basics\n\n1. Add a professional profile picture to catch the eye of recruiters. Your profile picture must be professional in order to give a good first impression. If you have use a profile picture that is inappropriate or silly, recruiters will probably remove you from their candidate list immediately. When choosing a profile picture, remember to choose one that:\n\t* Does not include anyone else but you. This reduces confusion regarding who the profile is about and draws all the focus to you. Is just of your head and shoulders. Your profile picture is a small picture and will show your face better if you limit it's scope to just your head and shoulders. Shows you wearing professional business attire. LinkedIn is a professional site. Wearing business attire in your picture is highly recommended. This includes a nice collared shirt and a suit jacket if you wish (for both men and women) or an unrevealing blouse for women. Is in front of a solid background. Solid backgrounds allow the focus to be on you and not what is going on behind you. Has a smile. A smile can make you seem more approachable to those who don't know you. Is preferably taken by someone else. It is OK if it is not done by a professional, but definitely no selfies.\n2. Write an eye-catching headline to draw readers in. Headlines are automatically filled with your most recent job title after you add your experience. These can be boring, and you should consider changing your headline to something more unique. To make yourself stand out, edit your headline to tell the reader who you are and what you are an expert in. For example, “Operations Executive\", \"Performance Driven, Airline Industry Expert”.\n3. Customize your URL to brand yourself. Customizing your URL allows you to reference your LinkedIn page easily in your resume or on business cards and other documents. It should remain simple, with the best kind of URL including just your first and last name with no spaces or special characters. For example, www.linkedin.com/in/firstlastname.\n4. Provide an outstanding summary to highlight your talents. Writing a LinkedIn summary is much like writing a professional biography. It should be brief, yet comprehensive enough to give the reader an overview of your career thus far. Also, it should be well-written and engaging to entice them to read through your profile further and accept or request to connect with you. While writing a summary, remember to include the following:\n\t* Tell your story in the first person. This means using the words I, my and mine to make your summary more conversational and easy to read. Explain your expertise and interests. Use examples to show your value to potential clients and future employers. Highlight your key accomplishments. If you have made some great achievements in your career, take the time to list these in your summary. For example, Top Sales Award Winner. State a call to action. Explain what you are looking for while making connections on LinkedIn. For example, “open to new opportunities”, “looking to make mutually beneficial connections” or “contact me if I can be assistance to you”.\n5. List each job you have held with a summary of tasks to provide detail. As with your resume, list all the jobs you have held. The difference between a LinkedIn profile and a resume is that it is acceptable to add any and all jobs to your experience section, rather than limiting yourself to what is most relevant to the particular job you are applying for, as with a resume. Also, you are also not limited to the 10 year rule as you would be on a resume. Therefore, feel free to list any job you have ever held in your career. Add a brief summary of the purpose of your job and the major tasks you have completed. Bullet key accomplishments. As with a resume, you want to highlight your strengths and accomplishments to show you were successful at your job. For example, “Negotiated a $1.5M sale to increase profit margins by 25%”.\n6. Add all relevant skills to your profile. The skills section of a LinkedIn profile can hold up to 50 skills. It is recommended for you to use all 50 of these slots to provide a full look at what you are capable of. This section is very easy to use because it populates suggestions as you are typing and allows you to click on these for a quick listing. For example, while typing “Coaching” it may also populate “Business Coaching, Job Coaching and Staff Coaching”.\n\n\n## Add support material\n\n1. Know your audience to target your profile's contents. Given your career path and the type of people you are trying to attract with your LinkedIn profile, you should know what readers will be looking for and you can give the audience what they want. For example, if you are a writer, your audience will be looking for your creativity and to remain engaged throughout your profile by your choice of words and correct grammar. If, however, you are a sales representative, your audience will be looking for your stats and your ability to sell yourself throughout your profile.\n2. Use concise and effective wording to create impact. Just as in a resume, you must keep your sentences concise (brief) and powerful by using effective wording to get your point across. This means using action words such as: drove, reduced, increased, created, initiated, trained, developed, won, and acquired.\n3. Use keywords to enhance your ranking in search results. Using keywords in your profile is extremely important because these keywords will be used by others who are looking to make connections. The more keywords you add that are related to your experience and field of interest, the higher your profile will rank when searched. For example if a recruiter is looking for someone with “sales and lead generation” experience they will add these keywords to the search field. To find the best keywords for you to use, browse job openings for various companies and pick out common words and phrases. If you have experience in these areas, use these keywords in your profile. If you have the experience but do not use the keywords, your profile will not appear in the proper search results.\n4. Add relevant presentations, videos and other files to show your expertise. LinkedIn allows you to get creative with your profile. For each job or education listed, you have the option to upload a document or file to further illustrate your experience. Adding these types of files is great for someone who produces work of a visual nature. For example, professional presentations, photographs, videos, ads and graphics. Be sure to add only files that are relevant to your personal experience and accomplishments, and not something about your company or school. For example, do not add a recruiting video about the company you work for.\n5. Ask for recommendations. Having recommendations in your LinkedIn profile is important, because instead of you telling the reader how great you are, they get a chance to hear it from someone else who has worked with you. Once you have made connections with those who you believe will write you a good recommendation, send them a message by clicking on the “Ask to be recommended” link under your profile edit page.\n6. Use special characters. You can use special characters to make your profile stand out by creating bullet points or breaking up a section and creating lines. However, not all symbols are accepted and translated into LinkedIn.\n",

    "original_question": "I recently had someone claim (on an unrelated SE site I won't link to) that it is the responsibility of a player to correctly identify their hand, that what you &quot;call&quot; your hand determines the winner:\n\nFor example, you have an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten. You call your hand and say, &quot;I have a Straight!&quot;\nBut that was a bad move on your part because you are a novice player and you did not notice that all of your cards are Spades. You actually had a Straight Flush, but now you have lost because one of the remaining players had a Full House.\nYour hand has not been determined until you call your hand.\n\nIs this true? Clearly you might play your hand differently if you misunderstand what you have, but I always thought that the cards speak for themselves once they are revealed.\nOr would it depend on the specific poker variation/house rules?",
    "response": "Casinos in the US generally have the \"cards speak\" rule. That is, when a hand is properly tabled--exposed to everyone at showdown--it is the responsibility of all players, the dealer, floormen, and anyone else present to see that the pot is awarded to the best hand shown, regardless of what the players might say.\n\nSome players object to this rule: they believe that if a player or railbird says \"Wait, Bob has a flush\", that's unfairly helping a player. But the rule is clear: once the hand is tabled, others have not only the right but the obligation to help ensure the pot is awarded correctly.\n\nThere are a couple of caveats: if a player only shows his hand to another player, or to the dealer, or to any other person, without properly tabling it for everyone, that player has no rights yet and those to whom the hand was shown should remain silent to protect other players' properly shown hands. But once the hand is tabled, it's fair game and everyone can and should assist in reading the hands.\n\nFinally, in some cases, if a floorman feels that a player has deliberately overcalled his hand to induce a player with a better hand to fold, he may penalize that player by awarding the pot to someone else, even possibly to a folded hand. Some California lowball clubs even had a rule that a player who remained silent rather than explicitly calling out a pair could be ruled against in this way.",

So congress should not make a law which prohibits the freedom of religion. I get it.\nBut Congress shall make a law which respects an establishment of religion. Doesn't \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" mean congress should not make a law that respects religion because there's \"no\" in it??  ",

    "original_question": "How to save gift wrapping paper?",
    "response": "We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4. Of course, take numerous photos (and possibly video) of the gift giving process.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "What are some ways to reduce smog?",
    "original_question": "How to reduce smog?",
    "response": "Smog is a form of air pollution that is produced in the atmosphere when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC). When this reaction occurs, particles are released into the atmosphere, and oxygen at the ground level absorbs harmful compounds (ozone). All of this creates what we consider smog. Recent years have seen an increase in campaigns for the reduction of smog due to its harmful effects towards both humans and the environment.\n\n## Change your car habit\n\n1. Drive less. Vehicles that run only on gasoline produce nitrogen dioxide as a byproduct of driving and idling, so one easy way to cut back on emissions is to drive less. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit instead. If your location is close enough, try walking or biking, especially if the destination has showers for clean up (workplace, gym, etc.). Many large cities offer public transportation such as buses, subways, trains and \"park and ride\" which allows you to park your vehicle and take public transit to your destination. Don't drive during certain times. For example, drive less during peak traffic periods, when it is extremely hot, or when there are ozone warnings in effect. This is because gas fumes turn into harmful ground level ozone when they heat up. If driving is a necessity, try setting up a carpool so there are fewer cars on the road and fewer trips being made.\n2. Maintain your car. Keeping your car \"healthy\" will not only improve mileage and save money, it can also reduce emissions. Get regular tune-ups and oil changes and make sure your tires are properly inflated to ensure your car is functioning at its best. Many states require smog and emission tests to make sure your car isn't emitting too much pollution. These are usually required annually or bi-annually. Inflating your tires to the correct pressure allows the engine to function better by maintaining a steady load. Consult your mechanic or your owner's manual for specific information regarding maintenance for your vehicle.\n3. Fuel up in cooler temperatures. Pump gas early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures drop. This prevents the fumes from gasoline from heating up and creating harmful toxins at ground level (ozone). There are alternative fuel sources that are in the works such as ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, but not all engines can function off of these fuel sources.\n4. Purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. These vehicles have been known to dramatically reduce emissions for many reasons (depending on the type of model). Some decrease the consumption of fuel while others do away with fuel altogether. The result is a reduction in tailpipe emissions and therefore a reduction in smog. Hybrid vehicles are fueled by gasoline alone but have the ability to recapture energy and use it to power the car, resulting in less fuel consumption. Electric vehicles are powered by electricity alone and must be plugged in and charged in order to drive. Plug-in hybrids are the best of both worlds, running off of either electricity or gasoline.\n\n\n## Change your consumption habit\n\n1. Avoid high VOC products. VOCs are chemicals that easily escape into the atmosphere through common use around the house. Check the front label of household products to determine if they contain VOCs. Examples of common products include nail care products (acetone, ethyl alcohol), paint strippers or adhesive removers (methylene chloride), and aerosol spray products (butane). Check the National Institute of Health's Household Products Database for more information about specific products and their ingredients. Shop for \"green\" products that don't contain VOCs. If you must use VOC products, buy in small quantities that can be used quickly instead of stored. If you must store the product, do so in a tightly sealed, original container, in a well-ventilated area.\n2. Avoid gas-powered yard equipment. Gasoline emissions are one of the major causes of smog--whether from vehicles or lawn equipment. Try eco-friendly lawn mowers, hedgers, trimmers, or any other lawn equipment that can be powered electrically. You can also avoid mowing altogether by changing the material in your yard. Opt for artificial grass, succulents, hard landscapes, or rock gardens to do away with mowing forever. This will also save you time and money spent on maintenance and watering. There are also \"real grass alternatives\" that look and act like traditional grass turf, but require less maintenance.\n3. Buy local. When you buy products that are made locally, it cuts down on the cost of transport which reduces emissions. Local farmers' markets and grocery stores can help you determine where items were produced. There are many sites online that link local buyers and sellers such as Direct Local Food, GrowBuyEat, and AgLocal. Besides farmers' markets, try local farmers' stands, farms, and wineries. There are even many restaurants that are joining the movement towards supporting locally grown items. Make a community garden. Grow vegetables and fruit for your community and local distribution.\n4. Be energy efficient in your home. The less energy you consume at home, the less pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to decrease energy consumption including through lighting, heating and cooling, and appliance use. Replace your old incandescent light bulbs with energy saving halogen incandescents, CFLs, and LEDs which can be found at your local hardware store. For heating and cooling try energy-saving thermostats that automatically reset temperatures while you're away from home. Shop for energy-efficient appliances that use less energy such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers.\n\n\n## Take a stand\n\n1. Don't support organizations that have poor environmental practices. By not supporting commerce from these companies, you raise awareness of the problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations. An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's barcode.\n2. Promote your stance. Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month. Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.\n3. Contact local politicians and business leaders. Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change. Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own. Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.\n",

    "original_question": "What factors determine the maximum altitude for a plane?\nIs it limited by wing design, engine thrust, and so on?\nIs there a formula by which one can calculate the maximum altitude a plane can reach?",
    "response": "The higher you get, the lower the density of the air becomes. This lower density results in a lower lift being generated for the same airspeed and angle of attack. Effectively, the higher you fly the higher your minimum speed becomes. So while climbing, your speed needs to increase to compensate for the lower air density. As long a you can fly faster, the lower density at altitude can be compensated for. \nBasically there are two things that limit your maximum speed: thrust and speed of sound and with that your maximum altitude.\nFirst is thrust; the higher you get, the lower the thrust your engines deliver. You might note that drag goes down with the air density as well but since you are flying faster and faster during the climb the drag doesn't decrease at all. If your maximum altitude is limited by thrust then at some point during the climb the thrust and drag are getting close to equal and that is where the climb stops. When you can no longer climb with more than 100ft per minute (for propeller aircraft) or 500ft per minute (for jet / turbofan aircraft) you have reached your service ceiling. If the aircraft maximum altitude is determined by thrust, the absolute ceiling will take very long to reach. \nAt high altitudes air breathing engines will get difficulties eventually. Due to the lower air density the mass flow through the engine is reduced up to a point where it causes a flame out. \nThe other limitation is the speed of sound, at least for subsonic aircraft. In the process of generating lift, air flowing over the top of the wing is accelerated. At one point, when the aircraft is still flying below the speed of sound, shock waves will start to form over the wing. This results in increase of drag and reduces the lift. So provided you have enough engine power at your disposal you can climb to an altitude where your minimum speed is also your maximum speed. This is called the coffin corner. In the coffin corner:\n\n* if you fly any faster, you will exceed the maximum Mach number ($M_{mo}$) of your aircraft, resulting in high speed buffet, vibrations and possible loss of control. \n* if you fly any slower, the maximum lift that the wing can provide will be insufficient to maintain altitude. Descent or the aircraft will stall. \n* if you fly any higher and you will be too fast and too slow at the same time. \n* if you turn, you increase the wing loading, thereby increasing the minimum speed needed to create the required lift. Also the outer wing will easily exceed the maximum speed while at the same time the inner wing is below stall speed. This can quickly develop into a spin. \n\nSince accurate knowledge of engine performance, drag and wing characteristics of the aircraft is needed, there is not a simple formula to derive the maximum altitude for an aircraft.  \n\nApart from the aircraft performance related limitations above there is a certified maximum operating altitude for the pressurized cabin. This takes into account the structural properties of the hull (pressure difference between inside and outside) and the achievable emergency descent rate in case of a depressurization event.",

    "original_question": "How to make churros?",
    "response": "The Mexican version of a quick fried cake, churros are incredible tasty treats that couldn't be easier to make. Whether you want to craft them from scratch or are looking for a quicker fix, anyone can whip up a batch of churros at home.\n\n## Make fresh churros\n\n1. Whip the two eggs together with the vanilla in a small bowl. It should be well blended and mixed. When done, set it aside for later. To make richer churros, you can add 1-2 more eggs, though this is totally up to taste.\n2. Heat up 1-1/2\" of oil in a large frying pan until 375°F. If you don't have a candy thermometer, keep everything on medium-low, and you'll be ready just as small amounts of \"smoke\" is rising from the top of the oil. If you drop a small test ball of dough in, the oil should immediately start bubbling. A thick-bottomed pan is always your best bet, as they hold heat much better than thinner pans. You can also wait to pre-heat the oil until after you've made the dough. However, this can take some time, so starting now is a good idea if you think you can do the dough quickly. If you do, just keep the burner on medium, not high, to prevent burning.\n3. In a medium saucepan, add the water, brown sugar, salt, and butter and heat until boiling. Stir it frequently, until everything is well dissolved and the mixture is bubbling nicely. Once it is a consistent, boiling mixture, immediately lower the heat to low.\n4. Add the flour to the hot water mixture all at once, stirring until a firm dough. This takes some arms, so really get in there with a wooden spoon to stir everything up into it is well blended. Turn the heat off when done.\n5. Pour the egg/vanilla mixture in and stir until you have a consistent dough. You should have a glossy ball of dough when you've mixed everything up completely. If you pull up on the dough sharply, it should keep it's hook shape. If it doesn't add and beat in another egg.\n6. Consider how you want to make the long, round shapes churros are famous for. There are a lot of ways to turn your ball of dough into long, delicious churros, and none of them are wrong. Use whatever works for you, making long, thin, cylindrical treats:\n\t* \n\t* Pinch and Roll: The simplest method, simply pull off a 2\" ball of dough and roll it between your hands to form a snake-like shape, roughly 1/2\" thick. Decorative Piper: Usually used for icing, these have star-shaped tips that will get the ridges found on fairground churros. Pack the dough where the icing goes and then push it through to make perfect, even logs of dough. DIY Decorative Piper: Take a large freezer back and fill it with dough. Then cut the bottom corner off the bag to form a small opening. Squeeze the dough through this whole to make your logs.\n7. Fry the logs in hot oil until golden brown on all sides, turning frequently. The total cooking time will depend on how thick the churros are, but you should be able to tell easily when they are done, as the outsides will be an alluring golden brown. Don't put more than 3-4 churros in the pan at once -- too much will drop the temperature of the oil rapidly, leading to greasy churros.\n8. Drain the finished churros on paper towels. Set them aside on a plate of paper towels, then lightly pat down the tops with more paper towels to get rid of excess oil.\n9. Combine white sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and roll the churros in the mixture. You've got your finished churros! Combine them in as much or as little cinnamon sugar as you want -- they'll be delicious either way. Some people take things a step further by drizzling the finished churros in chocolate sauce, too.\n\n\n## Make \"instant\" churros\n\n1. Purchase a roll of pre-made biscuits from your favorite brand. The dough in a \"real\" churro is a little different than the dough in a biscuit, but the basic ingredients are the same and they will cook similarly. It is usually best to use the smaller biscuits, allowing you to more easily fry everything. If you don't want the fat of biscuit batter, you can use 1 cup hot water and 3-1/4 cups of your favorite all-purpose pancake mix. Blend into a dough and proceed like normal.\n2. Take two biscuits and roll them in between your hands into ten-inch ropes. Churros need to be long and thin in order to really cook nicely. Try to make all the ropes roughly the same diameter for the best results.\n3. Twist biscuits together and pinch ends. Simply make a rope out of the biscuits by braiding one over the other, When done, pinch both ends together to fuse them. You can also lightly roll the whole thing together to keep the centers together.\n4. Alternatively, use an icing pipette or icing bag to pump out the strips. Simply put the dough into a large plastic bag, then snip off the bottom corner with scissors. You can push the dough straight out the bottom of the back in perfect strips.\n5. Pour vegetable oil into a medium-sized frying pan. Heat until it reached 375F. Make sure there is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of oil in the pan to cover the churros. There should be enough oil so that they float freely while frying, and all sides, except the very top, are being cooked at the same time. If you don't have an oil thermometer, 375 is when there is barely smoke coming off the top of the oil. Don't let it get much farther than this point.\n6. Drop the dough twists into the pan, turning occasionally. Fry for about 2 minutes, or until golden brown. They don't take long, but you can easily see when they are finished by the color on the outsides. Once they look good to eat, they usually are.\n7. Remove the churros with the slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel. Pat them down with paper towels to remove excess oil, which will make them soggy if it cools on the churro.\n8. Roll the twisted dough in cinnamon and sugar mixture. In a separate bowl, mix up 1/2 cup of sugar with a teaspoon of cinnamon. Then roll the warm churros in the mixture to coat them deliciously.\n9. Serve warm, with chocolate dip if desired. They are fine on their own or with a delicious chocolate dip. Enjoy!\n",

IMDb allows you to make these custom lists from their app or their website.\n\n## Via the imdb mobile app\n\n1. Open the IMDb app. IMDb can be found in the iPhone and Android app store. The icon may either be yellow with black lettering or clear with yellow lettering: this will differ from operating system to operating system.\n2. Try and view your current custom lists. Tap the person icon to the right of the search box; then tap the \"Your Lists\" option from between the Your Check-Ins and Your History options of your Watchlist options page. To get here on a tablet such as an iPad or Android tablet, instead, choose the hamburger menu to the left of the search bar at the top of the screen and choose \"Your lists.\"\n3. Tap \"Create a list\". This can be found up near the top of the screen, underneath the feature telling you how many lists you have and how they are sorted. It's just above all your current IMDb lists.\n4. Designate whether the list will be private or not. If you want it to be private, make sure the slider switch remains green. If you want it public, tap or slide the green slider switch to turn off the privatized settings for this new list.\n5. Tap the \"New list title\" label line and enter a new title for the custom list. When you've finished naming it, tap the \"Done\" button.\n6. Describe why you created the list. If there's a theme to the list, use this option to remind yourself what the purpose is. There is no true \"Done\" button, but you can proceed to the next step to finish the process instead; Return just line-advances to a new line below the current one.\n7. Tap the \"Save\" button in the top right corner of the screen.\n8. Stock the list with some initial content. Tap the list you just created. Tap the \"Add to List\" option. Type the title. The tool will begin searching for items you can add to the list. If by the end of the search the title just doesn't come up, you can press the Search button on your keyboard. Tap the item to add to list.\n9. Repeat for additional titles to add. Tap the + sign to the right of (1 title) instead for each successive addition.\n\n\n## Via the website\n\n1. Log in to the IMDb website in your web browser. Once you get to the website, you'll click either the \"Sign in with Facebook\" or \"Other sign in options\" buttons or links near the top right corner of the page; you can sign in via Facebook, Google, or Amazon, or you can create an IMDb account. Then you'll have free range to add stuff to your Watchlist at any time.\n2. Hover over your name near the right hand corner and click \"Your Lists\". This will take you to the page containing all your lists, including your Watchlist and list of check-ins. If you already have other lists, this page will also display these other lists by title only.\n3. Click the \"Create a New List\" button over on the right-hand side.\n4. Name your list. Click into the \"List Title\" field and type your name for the list. This is one of two mandatory fields to create the list.\n5. Describe your list. Click into the \"List Description\" box and type a description for the list.\n6. Tell IMDb what types of items you are planning to save in this list. On the IMDb mobile site, the types of Items is pre-populated. On the website, you have to choose one item from the drop-down list: your choices include: \"Titles\", \"People\" and \"Images\".\n7. Click the \"Create\" button once you are done.\n8. Click in the text box to the right of \"Add a movie or TV show to this list\".\n9. Search for the item, based on IMDb labeling and formatting and click the item once it appears. Unlike the mobile app, which shows you the profile images for the item, with the website version, you just get the name and release date for the item. Wait for the list to be populated with the item. It should take a few seconds to add the item to the list.\n10. Repeat with any other items you'd like to add to the list to create the list's initial structure.\n11.

In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”\n\nIt's pretty clear from the above verses that John was Elijah reincarnated.\nWouldn't the above verses imply that reincarnation is true? ",
    "response": "Faulty Premise #1: John the Baptist was a reincarnation of Elijah\n\nWhen Jesus asked Peter who people said he was, he answered that some people thought that Jesus was Elijah come back. Peter knew better and said Jesus was the Christ. In any event, John the Baptist himself directly denied the claim (see John 1:19-21). \nWhat Jesus more likely was saying in Matthew 11 is that John the Baptist was a prophet in the tradition of Elijah. Elijah was the greatest of the prophets (even if his disciple Elisha inherited a double portion of his spirit). All of the prophets that followed came in the name and spirit of Elijah, in the same way that some of Paul's letters apparently were created after his death. They were in the spirit and tradition even if not the actual man. \nNote also Elijah never died - he was taken up into heaven, and people thought he would return. As such, no Elijah was not being thought to have reincarnated- only returned. Elijah's return was long a part of Jewish custom. Even today, during a Passover sedar, a chair is left empty for Elijah. But again, since he did not die, Jews look for his return, not his reincarnation. \n\nFaulty Premise #2: The Jewish world view has  any concept of reincarnation at all\n\nThe most basic rule of hermeneutics suggests that a text cannot mean what it could not mean to the original audience. If the Jews had no concept of reincarnation, then any interpretation that says it does has a very, very high bar to clear.\nIn his book The Gift of the Jews, Thomas Cahill advances the thesis that the primary distinctive philosophy of the Jews was precisely that history was not circular. Their linear idea of a human life was a departure from others and was an explicit rejection of reincarnation. As such, a text would need to be exceedingly explicit to a culture that rejected circular life patterns, and the obscure interpretation above (especially in light of the more obvious intepretation) simply doesn't hold water.\nFurthermore, the book of Hebrews - written to the people into which both Jesus and John the Baptist were born - explicitly reject reincarnation. As the writer points out in 9:27, \n\n  It is appointed unto a man once to die and then the judgement.\n\nHere we do have an explicit rejection of reincarnation by the followers of Jesus. There is one death. There is one judgement. Hence, in any Christian worldview, you don't come back.",

    "response": "It depends on the tax system that applies to you, but there can be consequences, and they can be very severe.\n\nGenerally economic activity is defined as oriented on profit, so giving anything for free could qualify as self-promotion or donation.\n\nIn Poland, for example, only some costs of the company spend on promotion can be considered as tax costs. So in worst case you could end with tax office refusing to acknowledge, for example, 50% of your expenses as tax costs. You would end up with fine and penalty percentages.\n\nWith donation, the danger is even greater. There was a case of baker who was giving the unsold bread to charity for free. He was told to pay the VAT from the bread that was given for free (from the price it was normally being sold - but the tax officer is free to estimate the basis price as he/she wants). With penalty percentages the sum was so big, that he has become insolvent. However, the obligation to pay VAT was only in case of wares, not services, and the law has changed recently, but in other countries the regulations may be even stricter.\n\nThere is also a potential consequence if you receive something for free. It could be interpreted as income and you would have to pay income tax from the value estimated by tax officer.\n\nAssuming, analyse your local law, consult a tax specialist and be sure you exactly want what you are doing before issuing €0 invoices.",

    "original_question": "When to use UICollectionView instead of UITableView?",
    "response": "That depends on the requirements. How the application flows determines which type of UI to integrate into the application.\nPeople mainly use the ```UICollectionview``` for creating types of UIs with multiple images shown in a grid. This would have complex logic using ```UITableView```, but with ```UICollectionview```, it would be easy.\nWhen using ```UICollectionview```, you don't need to set buttons with tags or other things by getting selected items values. You can simply get ```-(void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath``` and in ```UITableViewDelegate```:\n````-(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath`\n```\nYou get the selected row instead of the item, so for creating grid or modified items, using ```UICollectionview``` is best.\nFor the listing details of each item, people use ```UITableView``` because it shows more info on each item.\nApple Docs:\nUICollectionView Class Reference\n\n  The UICollectionView class manages an ordered collection of data items and presents them using customizable layouts. Collection views provide the same general function as table views except that a collection view is able to support more than just single-column layouts. Collection views support customizable layouts that can be used to implement multi-column grids, tiled layouts, circular layouts, and many more. You can even change the layout of a collection view dynamically if you want.\n\nUITableView Class Reference\n\n  A table view displays a list of items in a single column. UITableView is a subclass of UIScrollView, which allows users to scroll through the table, although UITableView allows vertical scrolling only. The cells comprising the individual items of the table are UITableViewCell objects; UITableView uses these objects to draw the visible rows of the table. Cells have content—titles and images—and can have, near the right edge, accessory views. Standard accessory views are disclosure indicators or detail disclosure buttons; the former leads to the next level in a data hierarchy and the latter leads to a detailed view of a selected item. Accessory views can also be framework controls, such as switches and sliders, or can be custom views. Table views can enter an editing mode where users can insert, delete, and reorder rows of the table. ",

Because it behaves exactly like the companion, but it must have a name.\nIs there maybe a difference in its \"static\" (I'm from the java side) lifecycle? ",
    "response": "There are two different types of ```object``` uses, expression and declaration.\nObject Expression\nAn object expression can be used when a class needs slight modification, but it's not necessary to create an entirely new subclass for it.  Anonymous inner classes are a good example of this.\n```button.setOnClickListener(object: View.OnClickListener() {\n    override fun onClick(view: View) {\n        // click event\n    }\n})\n```\nOne thing to watch out for is that anonymous inner classes can access variables from the enclosing scope, and these variables do not have to be ```final```.  This means that a variable used inside an anonymous inner class that is not considered ```final``` can change value unexpectedly before it is accessed.\nObject Declaration\nAn object declaration is similar to a variable declaration and therefore cannot be used on the right side of an assignment statement.  Object declarations are very useful for implementing the Singleton pattern.\n```object MySingletonObject {\n    fun getInstance(): MySingletonObject {\n        // return single instance of object\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd the ```getInstance``` method can then be invoked like this.\n```MySingletonObject.getInstance()\n```\nCompanion Object\nA companion object is a specific type of object declaration that allows an object to act similar to static objects in other languages (such as Java).  Adding ```companion``` to the object declaration allows for adding the &quot;static&quot; functionality to an object even though the actual static concept does not exist in Kotlin.  Here's an example of a class with instance methods and companion methods.\n```class MyClass {\n  companion object MyCompanionObject {\n    fun actsAsStatic() {\n      // do stuff\n    }\n  }\n  fun instanceMethod() {\n    // do stuff\n  }\n}\n```\nInvoking the instance method would look like this.\n```var myClass = MyClass()\nmyClass.instanceMethod()\n```\nInvoking the companion object method would look like this.\n```MyClass.actsAsStatic()\n```\nSee the Kotlin docs for more info.",

Demonstrate with the opposites that the students labeled on the number line earlier.\n* Define the absolute value of a number as its distance from zero. Let students find the absolute values of the two opposites from the introduction.\n* Plot another point on the original number line. Ask students to find the absolute value of that number. Let one student explain their answer to the class.\n* Ask students if they notice a pattern about absolute value. Students should notice that absolute value is always positive.\n* Tell students that absolute value is also helpful for understanding real-world situations. Use an elevator example with the ground floor marked as zero. Ask students to measure the distance between underground or overground floors to the ground floor.\n\n###Guided Practice (10 minutes):\n* Provide students with an introductory absolute value worksheet. The worksheet should be as simple as possible.\n* Have students pair with partners to complete this worksheet. Check in on students while they work.\n\n###Independent Work (20 minutes)\n* Provide students with an absolute value word problems worksheet. This worksheet should help students connect absolute value to real-life situations.\n* Have students work independently on these word problems.\n\n###Assessment (10 minutes):\n* Ask students to find the absolute value of some numbers (e.g. -6, -3.5, 17) on a sheet of paper.\n* Write the temperatures -6°C, 1°C, and -3°C on the board. Ask students which is coldest.\n* Collect the students' answers to measure how well students understood this lesson.\n\n###Conclusion (5 minutes)\n* Let a student explain their answer to the temperature problem.\n* Ask students to define absolute value to their partner.",

    "original_question": "How to wear a cowboy hat properly?",
    "response": "Cowboy hats have a long tradition, both for functional purposes while working and as a fashion statement. Even if it seems as simple as setting the hat on your head and going about your business, there are some rules to follow if you want to wear a cowboy hat properly. You need to get a hat that fits right, shape it a little bit, make sure the front is forward, and angle to give your look the proper attitude.\n\n## Choose your hat\n\n1. Get the right size. The first step to properly wearing a cowboy hat is making sure the hat is the right size and fits your head properly. Cowboy hats should typically fit snug around your head. If you are buying one, know your hat size ahead of time but also try the hat on before you buy it.\n2. Fix your current hat to fit better. You may have a hat already that is just barely too big but not big enough that you would want to get a smaller size. You can fix this. You can buy foam strip that is specifically made to put into hats to make them fit tighter. Depending on how much you need, and the shape of your head, you can either put this foam all the way around, or you can put a little in the front and back, just on the sides, or even just the front or just the back. Figure out where your hat is fitting too loosely. If the whole hat is sitting too low on your head, you probably want to put some sizing foam around the whole hat. There should be a band around the inside of the hat that you can flip up and place the foam strip under. Then flip the band back down before wearing the hat.\n3. Pick the right hat. You have a lot of options when it comes to cowboy hats. The main material choices are felt (made of beaver or rabbit pelt), leather, and straw. Felt hats are warmer so they tend to be worn more in the cold seasons. Straw hats are better for staying cool during hot days.\n4. Shape your hat. Most cowboy hats can be conformed to a certain shape by gently bending and squeezing them. How exactly you do this will depend on the material of the hat itself. You want the front and back of the brim to be fairly flat. Curl the sides so they stick up just slightly. You don’t want to curl them too tightly. You can also gently dent the sides of the crown of the hat. No tools are required for this. Simply use your hands.\n\n\n## Put the hat on your head\n\n1. Adjust your hair. You need to make sure that your hair does not get in the way of your hat sitting properly on your head. If you have short hair, this won’t apply to you. For longer hair, it can be a good idea to slick your hair back so it lays smoothly. Don’t pile your hair up on your head in any way. If you need to tie it in place, a ponytail that hangs straight down is the best option.\n2. Put the bow to the back. One of the most basic rules is making sure that the hat is on your head correctly with the front to the front. Most cowboy hats have a small bow on the inside lining around the headband. The bow should be in the back of your head. If your hat does not have this bow, a general rule is that the hat will be narrower at the front.\n3. Angle your brim accordingly. Positioning your hat in different ways can affect the way you look in the way. If you want to appear casual and friendly, tilt the front of the hat up just slightly so you can see about half of you forehead. To look more serious, or almost mysterious, lower the brim to just above your eyebrows. Slanting the hat slightly to the left or right will give you an appearance of being confident, almost to the point of looking for women or for trouble.\n4. Pick the right outfit. Your best and simplest bet to wear with a cowboy hat is a button up shirt, jeans, and a nice pair of cowboy boots. The shirt be a plain color or plaid. Flannel shirt work well too. You want basic, straight leg blue jeans with no extra pockets on the sides, no designs or extra buttons on the back pockets, no intentional bleaching or stain marks. Just classic blue jeans. If you are going to wear a cowboy hat, boots are pretty much a must. It’s going to look wrong if you try to go out with some sneakers on. You should also tuck in your shirt and most likely wear a nice black or brown leather belt. Fancy belt buckle is optional.\n",

The note should cover the general model, the local volatility model and the main issues it does not solve such as the smile observed in markets and the issue with barrier options, and possible extensions to the local volatility model such as stochastic interest rates, stochastic volatilities, the Stochastic Volatility model etc...",
    "original_question": "In Dupire's local volatility model, the volatility is is a deterministic function of the underlying price and time, chosen to match observed European option prices.\nTo be more specific, given a smooth surface $(K,T)\\mapsto C(K,T)$ where K is the strike and T is time to maturity. Dupire equation implies that there exits an unique continuous function $\\sigma_{loc}$ defined by\n$$\\sigma_{loc}^{2}(K,T)=\\frac{\\partial_{T}C(K,T)+rK\\partial_{K}C(K,T)}{\\frac{1}{2}K^{2}\\partial_{KK}C(K,T)}$$ for all $(K,T)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times(0,\\infty)$ such that the solution to the stochastic differential equation $dS_{t}/S_{t}=rdt+\\sigma(t,S_{t})dW_{t}$ exactly generates the European call option prices.\nWhat do the dynamics of the local volatility mean? Are dynamics equivalent to the volatility surface? Why the dynamics of local volatility model is highly unrealistic?",
    "response": "A general model (with continuous paths) can be written\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r_t dt + \\sigma_t dW_t^S\n$$\nwhere the short rate $r_t$ and spot volatility $\\sigma_t$ are stochastic processes. \nIn the Black-Scholes model both $r$ and $\\sigma$ are deterministic functions of time (even constant in the original model). This produces a flat smile for any expiry $T$. And we have the closed form formula for option prices\n$$\n  C(t,S;T,K) = BS(S,T-t,K;\\Sigma(T,K))\n$$\nwhere $BS$ is the BS formula and $\\Sigma(T,K) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T-t}\\int_t^T \\sigma(s)^2 ds}$. This is not consistent with the smile observed on the market. In order to match market prices, one needs to use a different volatility for each expiry and strike. This is the implied volatility surface $(T,K) \\mapsto \\Sigma(T,K)$. \nIn the local volatility model, rates are deterministic, instant volatility is stochastic but there is only one source of randomness\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r(t) dt + \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) dW_t^S\n$$\nthis is a special case of the general model with\n$$\n  d\\sigma_t = (\\partial_t \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + r(t)S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + \\frac{1}{2}S_t^2\\partial_S^2\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)) dt + \\frac{1}{2}S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)^2 dW_t^S\n$$\nWhat is appealing with this model is that the function $\\sigma_{Dup}$ can be perfectly calibrated to match all market vanilla prices (and quite easily too). \nThe problem is that while correlated to the spot, statistical study show that the volatility also has its own source of randomness independent of that of the spot. Mathematically, this means the instant correlation between the spot and vol is not 1 contrary to what happens in the local volatility model. \nThis can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. The forward smile. Forward implied volatility is implied from prices of forward start options: ignoring interest rates,\n$$\n  C(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K) := E^Q[(\\frac{S_{T+\\theta}}{S_{T}}-K)_+] =: C_{BS}(S=1,\\theta,K;\\Sigma(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K))\n$$\nAlternatively, it is sometimes defined as the expectation of implied volatility at a forward date. In a LV model, as the maturity $T$ increases but $\\theta$ is kept constant, the forward smile gets flatter and higher. This is not what we observe in the markets where the forward smile tends to be similar to the current smile.\n\nThis is because the initial smile you calibrate the model too has decreasing skew:\n$$\n\\partial_K \\Sigma(0,S;T,K) \\xrightarrow[T\\to +\\infty]{} 0\n$$ \n\n2. Smile rolling. In a LV model, smile tends to move in the opposite direction of the spot and get higher independently of the direction of the spot.\nThis is not consistent with what is observed on markets. See Hagan and al. Managing Smile Risk for the derivation. This means that\n$\\partial_S \\Sigma_{LV}(t,S;T,K)$ often has the wrong sign so your Delta will be wrong which can lead to a higher hedging error than using BS. \n3. Barrier options. In FX markets, barrier options like Double No Touch are liquid but a LV model calibrated to vanilla prices does not reproduce these prices. This is a consequence of the previous point.   \n\nThe LV model is a static model. Its whole dynamic comes from the volatility surface at time 0. But the vol surface has a dynamic that is richer than that.\nThere are alternatives using multiple factors like SV models, LSV models (parametric local vol like SABR or fully non parametric local vol), models of the joint dynamic of the spot and vol surface etc... but the LV model remains the default model in many cases due to its simplicity, its ability to calibrate the initial smile perfectly and its numerical efficiency.

    "response": "This is definitely allowed, and a good tactic to leverage a cash advantage.\nThere is no minimum or maximum price for an auction.  The rules state:\n\nBidding may start at any price.\n\nMonopoly auctions do not have &quot;the bidding will start at $10&quot;.  They just have &quot;bidding is open&quot;.  Once the auction begins, a bid by any player sets the minimum price for the auction at that bid.  Your opponent could easily bid $10 on the property, forcing you to either let them have it for $10 or bid more than you have in cash.  You could bid first, say starting the bid at $5, but that doesn't meaningfully change the situation, as they can just respond by out-bidding you at $10.\n\nYou may bid more money than you have in cash, but you are still obligated to pay it if you win the auction.

    "original_question": "What does ```class``` do in Ruby?",
    "response": "First, the ```class``` syntax opens up ```foo```'s singleton class (eigenclass). This allows you to specialise the behaviour of methods called on that specific object.\n```a = 'foo'\nclass << a\n  def inspect\n    '\"bar\"'\n  end\nend\na.inspect   # => \"bar\"\na = 'foo'   # new object, new singleton class\na.inspect   # => \"foo\"\n```\n\nNow, to answer the question: ```class``` opens up ```self```'s singleton class, so that methods can be redefined for the current ```self``` object (which inside a class or module body is the class or module itself). Usually, this is used to define class/module (\"static\") methods:\n```class String\n  class << self\n    def value_of obj\n      obj.to_s\n    end\n  end\nend\nString.value_of 42   # => \"42\"\n```\nThis can also be written as a shorthand:\n```class String\n  def self.value_of obj\n    obj.to_s\n  end\nend\n```\nOr even shorter:\n```def String.value_of obj\n  obj.to_s\nend\n```\n\nWhen inside a function definition, ```self``` refers to the object the function is being called with. In this case, ```class``` opens the singleton class for that object; one use of that is to implement a poor man's state machine:\n```class StateMachineExample\n  def process obj\n    process_hook obj\n  end\nprivate\n  def process_state_1 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_2\n    end\n  end\n  def process_state_2 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_1\n    end\n  end\n  # Set up initial state\n  alias process_hook process_state_1\nend\n```\nSo, in the example above, each instance of ```StateMachineExample``` has ```process_hook``` aliased to ```process_state_1```, but note how in the latter, it can redefine ```process_hook``` (for ```self``` only, not affecting other ```StateMachineExample``` instances) to ```process_state_2```. So, each time a caller calls the ```process``` method (which calls the redefinable ```process_hook```), the behaviour changes depending on what state it's in.",

    "response": "A paper is bad enough, but presentations are even more nerve-wracking. You've got the writing down, but how do you turn it into a dynamic, informative, enjoyable presentation? Why, here's how!\n\n## Guidelines and audience\n\n1. Know the requirements. Each presentation for each class is going to be a bit different. Some instructors will be happy with 3 minutes while others will demand you stand there awkwardly for 7. Have all the guidelines clear when you go to write your presentation. Know how long the speech must be. Know how many points you're required to cover. Know if you must include sources or visuals.\n2. Know your audience. If you're giving a presentation to your classmates, you probably have a rough idea of their knowledge on the topic. But for virtually every other circumstance, you may be in the dark. Either way, cater your paper to make zero assumptions. If you're presenting to people you know, it'll be easy to know what to break down and what to gloss over. But if you're presenting to unknown stockholders or faculty, for instance, you need to know about them and their knowledge levels, too. You may have to break your paper down into its most basic concepts. Find out what you can about their backgrounds.\n3. Know your resources. If you are giving a presentation in a facility you've never visited before, it's best to inquire about what you'll have at your disposal and what you'll need to set up beforehand. Does the facility have a computer and projector screen? Is there a working WiFi connection? Is there a microphone? A podium? Is there someone who can assist you in working the equipment before your presentation?\n\n\n## Script and visuals\n\n1. Create a script for your presentation. Although you could write everything out, it's best to use notes to jog your memory -- you'll sound more like you're talking and be able to make more eye contact. Only have one point per notecard -- that way you won't end up searching the notecard for your information. And don't forget to number the cards in case you get mixed up! And the points on your cards shouldn't match your paper; instead of regurgitating information, discuss why the key points of your paper are important or the different points of view on this topic within the field.\n2. Decide on a limited number of ideas you want your audience to comprehend and remember. To do this, find the most important points in your paper. These are the ones you should be drilling home. The rest of your presentation should be extras not necessarily addressed in your work -- if they've already read the paper, they don't need to be lectured on it. They're there to learn more. Make an outline of the highlights to help you prepare your presentation. As you form the outline, you'll see what aspects of your paper pop out the most and what order they would best be relayed in. As you go through this outline, remove any jargon if it may not be understood.\n3. Design visual aids to make your presentation even better. To help your audience follow along (and for the visual learners), use slides with graphics, charts, and bullet points to make everything a bit more captivating. It can enhance the information in your paper, yes, but it also keeps everyone from wiggling around in their seats. If you have any statistics at all, turn them into graphs. The contrasts will seem more stark when put in pictures before your audience -- numbers are sometimes meaningless. Instead of thinking about 25% and 75%, they'll be thinking about the 50% difference they see before them. If you won't have access to the proper technology, print visual aids on poster board or foam-core board. Presentation software (Powerpoint, etc.) can also double as notecards. Instead of messing with small pieces of paper, you can just click a button to get your next prompt. If using presentation software, use words sparingly, but enough to get your point across. Think in phrases (and pictures! ), not sentences. Acronyms and abbreviations are okay on the screen, but when you talk, address them fully. And remember to use large fonts -- not everyone's vision is fantastic.\n4. Think in terms of conversation. Just because this is paper-based does not mean your delivery should be equivalent to what an 8.5 x 11 can do. You have personality and are a human engaging with an audience. Use their humanness to do things you might not otherwise do in a paper. It's okay to be a bit repetitive. Emphasizing important ideas will enhance comprehension and recall. When you've gone full circle, cycle back to a previous point to lead your audience to the right conclusion. Minimize the unnecessary details (the procedure you had to go through, etc.) when highlighting the main ideas you want to relay. You don't want to overload your audience with fluff, forcing them to miss the important stuff. Show enthusiasm! A very boring topic can be made interesting if there is passion behind it.\n\n\n## Practice, practice, and more practice\n\n1. Practice your presentation in front of friends and family members. Don't be shy -- ask for constructive criticism. This helps you know whether or not you're meeting the time requirements and if not, how you could tweak your style. And once you've recited it 20 times before breakfast, your nervous should be at a minimum. If you can grab a friend who you think has a similar knowledge level to your audience, all the better. They'll help you see what points are foggier to minds with less expertise on the topic.\n2. Tape record yourself. Alright, so this one is a little much, but if you're really nervous, you may find listening to yourself beneficial. You can see which parts you're nervous about and which parts you have nailed down. It'll help you to see the flow, too, when you listen back. It'll also help you with volume. Some people get rather timid when in the spotlight. You may not be aware that you're not loud enough!\n3. Be warm. You are allowed to be a person, not just a machine that relays facts. Welcome in your audience and take a few seconds to establish a comfortable atmosphere. Do the same with your conclusion. Thank everyone for their time and open the floor for any questions, if allowed.\n",

    "response": "Já foi dito que ```string``` é apenas um alias para o tipo ```String```.\nPara deixar claro, não há diferença em performance ou forma como o código é gerado. Há exatamente zero diferença no tratamento de ambas. Elas podem fazer as mesmas coisas, e todos os membros estão disponíveis em qualquer um deles, afinal assim se comporta um alias.\nDiferenças úteis na utilização e escolha:\n\n* ```string``` é apenas uma forma mais simples de usar o tipo ```String``` no C#, ou seja, ```string``` é a forma de &quot;tipar&quot; uma cadeia de caracteres no C# e ```String``` é um tipo do CLR. No C#, dependendo do contexto, é melhor usar uma ou outra forma. O tipo ```String``` presente no namespace ```System``` pode ser usado em qualquer linguagem que se utilize do CLR.\n\n* ```string``` não pode ser usado com reflexão. ```String``` deve ser usado no lugar.\n\n* ```String``` pode ser usado para criar outros aliases:\n``` using str = System.String;\n //...\n str s = &quot;Foi usado outro alias para string.&quot;;\n // a variável 's' é do tipo System.String que é o mesmo que ser string\n```\nMas esse é apenas um exemplo, não há necessidade e não é recomendado usar em código real. Existe sim casos que um alias pode ser útil, mas esse apenas dificulta a leitura para quem não está acostumado com isso, sem trazer nenhum benefício.\n\n* Há alguns locais que ocorre o oposto e criar um alias pode trazer mais legibilidade ao código.\n\n* Em outros casos pode ser apenas estranho usar um ou outro e dificultar a leitura.\n\n* Na verdade o tipo ```String``` deve ser usado como ```System.String``` ou onde exista um ```using System```, enquanto que ```string``` pode ser usado em qualquer código que o compilador já entenderá.\n\n* ```String``` pode ser usado como identificador válido. ```string``` é uma palavra reservada e não pode ser um identificador.\n\n* Há uma diferença na forma como o syntax highlight apresenta ambos. Pois uma forma é tipo e a outra é palavra chave.\n\n* Apesar da recomendação geral em usar ```string``` sempre que possível enquanto está programando em C#, há controvérsias no seu uso. Alguns alegam que ```String``` é preferencial para deixar claro, através do Pascal Case, que você está usando um tipo de referência(en).\nMas não faz muito sentido porque ```Int32``` é tipo de valor(en) e também usa PascalCase (ou lowerCamelCase). E ainda ele, apesar de ser tipo de referência, tem semântica de valor. Então mesmo que usasse a lógica de Pascal Case para tipo de referência, e Camel Case (ou (UpperCamelCase) para tipo de valor, pela semântica, que é o que importa, ele deveria ser Camel Case, ou seja, deveria começar com minúsculo mesmo.\nNo CLR o estilo de case é usado para ajudar determinar outras características do identificador.\n\n* É possível substituir o tipo oficial por outro seu com mesmo nome se fizer tudo corretamente. O *alias *apontará para esse novo tipo que tem o mesmo nome e é colocado da mesma forma. Se ele não for exatamente o mesmo nome (incluindo o namespace) aí ele só pode ser usado opcionalmente o que quase inviabiliza o uso real.\n\n\nImportante lembrar que ele é um tipo como outro qualquer por referência com semântica por valor e algumas facilidades que o compilador dá. O mesmo vale se usar ```String```.\nTambém vale lembrar que não existe tipo primitivo em C# (outra referência). Isso existe só como conceito do CLR, mesmo assim não como algo fundamental.\nImportante notar que tudo isso é válido para o C#, outras linguagens como Java, ou até mesmo VB.NET podem ter mais diferenças.\n\n* Documentação oficial do ```string``` dizendo que é um alias.\n* FAQ reafirmando sobre aliases de tipos.\n* ```System.String```.\n\nColoquei no GitHub para referência futura.",

    "generated_instruction": "Generate 3 methods of playing games to review information. The game should be something like a memory game or something, so you can recall the information later.",
    "original_question": "How to study using a game method?",
    "response": "## Play the concentration game\n\n1. Create game pieces. Make small cards using paper or something sturdier such as cardstock. Cut small squares out and be sure to make each piece the same size. Since this is a memory game, it is important that each card looks the same so you are unable to differentiate one card from the next.\n2. Write out information on game pieces. Work in pairs when writing out your review information on these cards. Write down a vocabulary word on the first card in the pair and its definition on the second. Continue writing on your cards until each review item has been covered. This game words best when reviewing things like definitions, spelling, examples, etc.\n3. Organize your cards. Flip over all your cards so that the writing is underneath. Place your cards face down and organize them into rows and columns until every game piece is situated.\n4. Flip over one card. Begin the game by choosing just one card to turn over. Read the definition or vocabulary word and choose one more card to turn over. If you flipped over the correct card, you should have a pair in which both cards are a match. When first starting out, this game is sheer luck, but after a few tries you will be able to remember where each card lies and can do your best to find its correct match.\n5. Set aside pairs. When you have found two cards that are a match, set that pair aside so that your game board becomes smaller. Continue playing until every card has been turned over and you have created matches for each game piece. When you are finished playing, you can simply shuffle your cards and redistribute them to create your game board and play again.\n\n\n## Play with card\n\n1. Obtain a deck of cards. The first thing you need to do is get an entire deck of cards. Be sure you aren’t missing any because it will affect how you play the game.\n2. Create a list of review items. Using your study materials, create a list of items you want to review. This list must be numbered and can be anything from definitions to vocabulary.\n3. Pull out face cards from your deck. You want to eliminate any face cards from your deck because the only cards needed are those with numbers. You may set the face cards aside until you have finished playing. An alternative to pulling out face cards is using them to play the game. Treat these cards like wild cards and whenever you draw one you can choose to review any item from your list that you wish to review.\n4. Shuffle your cards. It is very important to shuffle your deck. By doing this, you will ensure that each review item gets chosen by mixing up the numbers within the deck.\n5. Draw cards. Place your cards in a pile after shuffling them and draw the first card off the top. You may set aside all the cards you have already drawn.\n6. Review information corresponding to the number on each card. Look at the number on the card you drew and find the corresponding number on your list of review items. Review the information for that particular number. Continue to draw cards and review the information corresponding to those cards until you have gone through the entire deck.\n\n\n## Play a guess game\n\n1. Create a list of questions. Before generating a list of game questions, you must first go through all of your study materials and review critical information. While reviewing, form questions and produce a list.\n2. Cut small pieces of paper. Once your list is created you are ready to craft several pieces of small paper. These pieces of paper will serve as the main game pieces. Use card stock or heavy-duty paper for sturdy game pieces. Use sticky notes as another option to quickly create piece.\n3. Number papers. You created your main game pieces so now you must number them according to how many questions you developed.\n4. Put papers in container. Place all of your numbered game pieces into the container and be careful not to forget any. Be sure to shake the container once you’ve put all your game pieces inside to ensure the pieces are mixed sufficiently.\n5. Draw paper from container. Keep your list of questions next to you as you pull pieces out of the container. Choose randomly from the container and read the number on the piece of paper.\n6. Answer corresponding questions. Find the number on your question list that corresponds to the number on your game piece and read that question.\n7. Set aside used pieces. After answering each question, put the used game pieces aside so as not to repeat any. If you are unable to recall the correct answers to any questions you can make two piles designating one for challenging questions and one for easy questions. When you play the game for again, you can just put the challenging questions inside the container and spend less time reviewing the questions you already know.\n8. Repeat steps until container is empty. Continue draw the papers from the container until you’ve used them all. To play again, simply fill up the container and start over.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "What should you do if you find a friend of yours on Facebook threatening to kill themselves? What can you do to help them, and how can you take care of yourself at the same time?",
    "original_question": "How to react if you see a suicidal post on facebook?",
    "response": "## Respond on facebook\n\n1. Comment and encourage the person to seek help. Many people ignore suicidal social media posts for various reasons. However, social media suicide threats should be considered as serious as any other suicide threat. You may want to reply back to the person or send them a private message where you encourage them to seek help. Consider sending them the numbers to a suicide hotline to talk with a trained suicide counselor. Two suicide hotline numbers you can give them are 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) or 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Suicide.org provides suicide hotlines broken down by state, and also provides international numbers. They also give numbers for Spanish speaking hotlines, and hotlines geared towards specific groups, such as LGBT youth and military veterans.\n2. Report the post. When you see a suicide status update on Facebook, you have the option to report the post. When you report the post, it alerts Facebook that the poster may need help. Facebook then sends the person a message asking them if they would like to talk to someone (like a helpline worker) or be sent some tips to help them work through the problem. Reporting the post is anonymous, so the poster won’t know you reported them. To find the “Report Post” link, look for the arrow in the top right of the status box. When you hit the arrow, it should give you the option to “Report Post.”\n3. Use Facebook’s “Report Suicidal Content” option. When you see a suicidal message on Facebook, you can report them directly to Facebook. This option is different than simple reporting the post. You find the \"report suicidal content\" page in Facebook's help section and provide information directly to Facebook. You will need to provide the person’s name, the link to their profile, a link to the suicidal content, and a screenshot of the post.\n\n\n## Help the person\n\n1. Contact the person’s family and friends. If you see a suicide threat but are not close enough to the person to contact them yourself, reach out to the person’s family or friends. They may not be aware of the post. Let them know what you saw on Facebook and that you are worried about the poster. The person’s family and friends may be able to reach the person better than you can. They may be aware of a suicide plan already in place that you don’t know about. For example, you may say, \"I saw a post on Jane's Facebook page where she threatened to commit suicide. I am concerned about her and wasn't sure if you knew about this post.\"\n2. Reach out to the person. You may want to reach out to the person and offer support. Start off by offering to listen to the person. Don’t be afraid to ask, “Are you thinking about suicide?” and “What has led you to feel this way?” Listen as the person shares their feelings with you. Comfort the person. Be kind, gentle, and supportive as you let the person know that you are there for them. Let the person know that you are concerned about them. Say, “I am concerned about your safety and your life. You are important.”\n\t* Tell the person you care about them and they mean something to you. For example, say, “You are important to me. I care about you.” You may even want to pay them a visit if you live close to the person and know them well.\n3. Call emergency services. If a person is threatening to commit suicide, they need help. If you believe they need immediate help because they are going to commit suicide very soon, call 911 or other emergency services. Do not feel bad or embarrassed about calling for help. A threat of suicide is serious and needs to be dealt with accordingly. When you contact emergency services, tell them that the person is threatening to commit suicide via Facebook and you are concerned about their safety and life. You can also try calling a suicide prevention hotline yourself to ask for help with how to deal with the situation.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Do what you can. You may get extremely upset if you see someone you know or care about threatening to commit suicide. You should do what you can to help the person, but then let it go. Don’t let yourself get inappropriately emotionally invested in the situation. You cannot control what the person does, only what you do to help. Once you have helped, there is nothing more you can do. You can check up on the person and offer support as they deal with the aftermath of the suicide threat. However, make sure to set up boundaries to protect your own mental health. Remember that you can only control your life and not the other person’s. To set up boundaries, start by addressing what is in your power to do. This may be calling 911, contacting their family, or reaching out to them and listening. Next, you should do what you can. Tell yourself, \"These are the actions that are within my control to do.\" Then, remove yourself emotionally from the situation. You can only control what you do, not what they do. Remind yourself, \"I have done what I could do. I am not in control of the other person. I now will have to let it go and take care of myself.\"\n2. Refrain from being the person’s counselor. You should not try to counsel the person yourself. Reaching out to the person, checking on them to gauge their mental status, and letting them know you care are important things you can do. However, you should let the professionals counsel the person. Don’t try to give the person advice or convince them not to commit suicide. You are not a trained suicide counselor, so you should leave that to the professionals. You may say something to trigger a negative response or something that may upset the person’s fragile emotional and mental state.\n3. Talk to a counselor. If you have helped someone who threatened suicide on Facebook, the experience may have taken an emotional toll on you. You may want to discuss your experience and feelings with a trained counselor who can help you sort through any grief, guilt, or other negative feelings. Even if the person is fine, getting involved may affect you. Instead of trying to “get over it” on your own, talk through the experience with someone trained in dealing with these situations. You may say to the counselor, \"I recently had someone I know threaten to commit suicide on Facebook. This really affected me. I cannot imagine the world without this person, and I keep worrying that they are going to go through with it. I know I am obsessing about this, and I need help to learn how to cope.\"\n",

And should I have a frozen chicken meal cooked at an unsafe temperature? Or could you give me a few simple tips on how to safely cook chicken from frozen, perhaps? It would be helpful if you include instructions to use a slow cooker with frozen chicken parts.",
    "original_question": "How to safely cook chicken from frozen?",
    "response": "If you are in a rush, you may not have the time to thaw chicken for a meal. Luckily, you can save yourself some time and safely cook chicken from frozen. You can roast a whole, frozen chicken for a large group, or bake breasts or drumsticks for a smaller meal. Regardless of how much chicken you cook, it is important to always follow the safety guidelines for cooking chicken and thoroughly cook your meat to avoid any foodborne illnesses.\n\n## Roast a whole chicken from freeze\n\n1. Use caution when cooking frozen chicken. If you are cooking any parts of a chicken from frozen, there is an increased risk for foodborne illness. To kill any pathogens in the chicken, be sure to cook the meat to an internal temperature of at least 165°F (74°C). Always prepare from frozen chicken in the oven or on the stovetop and, as a rule of thumb, cook it about 50 percent longer than you would thawed meat. For example, it would take about two hours to roast a thawed 5-pound (2.25 kg) roasting hen at 350°F (177°C). If frozen, a similarly sized chicken would take about three hours to cook thoroughly at the same temperature. Check the internal temperature of the meat by inserting a meat thermometer into thickest part of the breast and the innermost part of the thigh and wing. If the thermometer does not ready 165°F (74°C), continue cooking the bird. Do not try to cook the frozen chicken in a slow cooker. The appliance will not get hot enough to kill the pathogens in the meat. It also leaves the meat sitting for too long at unsafe temperatures.\n2. Preheat the oven. Turn on your oven and heat it to 350ºF (177ºC). While your oven warms up, put the frozen chicken breast-side-up in a large roasting pan. This will ensure that the densest meat of the bird gets thoroughly cooked. Depending on the size of the chicken, you may also be able to use a Dutch oven instead of a roasting pan.\n3. Dress the chicken. If the bird is not frozen closed, try to remove the giblets from inside of the chicken. Once you remove the giblets, stuff the bird with your favorite ingredients, such as lemon, onion, rosemary, and thyme. Then rub the exterior of the chicken with olive oil and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. If you cannot access the inside of the bird, wait until it has cooked for about 45 minutes to remove the giblets. Use tongs and an oven mitt to remove the giblets and insert any stuffings that you want.\n4. Cook the chicken. Place the seasoned chicken in the oven uncovered and roast for about 90 minutes. Then increase the temperature of the oven to 450ºF (232ºC) and cook the chicken for another 15 to 30 minutes. This will help brown the skin. Remove the pan from the oven and serve once a meat thermometer placed into various parts of the chicken reads 165°F (74°C). These cooking times are based on a 4-pound (1.8 kg) chicken. Be sure to adjust the roasting time based on the weight of your chicken. Let the chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes to cool before carving. If there is any pink or red meat, place the whole bird or uncooked pieces back in the oven until they turn white and there is no red in the juices.\n\n\n## Prepare bread chicken breast from freeze\n\n1. Freeze the breasts individually. When you bring the chicken breasts home from the grocery store, place them in single layer in a freezer bag. Make sure that there is some space between the breasts. If they freeze together, it will be hard to separate them and you will likely have to thaw them. You can also freeze the breasts flat on a plate or tray and then transfer them to a freezer bag. This is a good strategy for freezing any individual chicken parts.\n2. Preheat the oven. Preheat your oven to 425ºF (218ºC). While the oven warms, lightly oil a baking sheet. You can use olive oil, vegetable oil, or any other preferred cooking oil or fat. Then place four boneless skinless chicken breasts on the tray. If you are cooking frozen chicken breasts without breading, preheat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC).\n3. Add breading. As the oven warms, mix 1/3-cup (113 g) dry breadcrumbs, ½-teaspoon (3 g) salt, ¼-teaspoon (1.5 g) of black pepper, ¼-teaspoon (1.5 g) garlic powder with one tablespoon (15 ml) of cooking oil. Spread about one teaspoon (5 ml) of mustard on the top of the frozen chicken breasts. Then sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture onto the breasts, making sure that the mix sticks to the mustard.\n4. Bake the breasts. Place the tray in the oven and cook the breasts for about 30 to 40 minutes. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast to make sure that it is cooked thoroughly. If the temperature is below 165°F (74°C) or if there is any red or pink meat, put the breasts back in the oven and let them cook until they are white and the juices run clear. If you are cooking four frozen 4-oz (28 g) chicken breasts without any breading, you should cook them at 350ºF (177ºC) for 30 to 45 minutes. However, it is important to remember that the cooking time depends on the size of the chicken breasts.\n\n\n## Bake freeze chicken legs\n\n1. Season the legs before freezing. Because it is difficult to get seasoning to stick to frozen chicken skin, it may be easier to season your drumsticks before freezing them. Before you put them in the freezer, coat your drumsticks with your desired seasoning or rub. This will freeze the seasoning to the skin and make it easier to pull the legs from the freezer and toss them in the oven when you are ready to cook. This is a great way to season any individual pieces of chicken before you freeze them.\n2. Preheat the oven. Heat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC). While the oven warms, remove your drumsticks from the freezer and place them on a tray. For a side, you may also want to add some chopped vegetables like carrots and onions or a few sliced potatoes to the tray.\n3. Cook the drumsticks. Place the tray in the oven and cook the drumsticks for about 50 to 60 minutes. Once the time is up, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the drumstick to make sure that it is cooked. If the temperature is below 165°F (74°C) or if there is any red or pink meat, put the breasts back in the oven and let them cook until they are white and the juices run clear. When you are taking the temperature of the drumsticks, try not to touch the bone with your thermometer. This will give you an inaccurate temperature.\n",

    "original_question": "What is the difference between kerning vs. letter spacing?",
    "response": "Any font has built-in spacing determined by the “side bearing” of each character. In metal type, the side bearing is the physical right or left edge of the individual piece of type that determines its spacing from the characters on either side. Digital fonts mimic this in the basic design process.\n\n* “To kern” means to adjust the spacing between a pair of letters, numerals, punctuation, etc.  (properly “glyphs”) so that their spacing looks correct. The letters AV, for example, have to overlap in any usual typeface, otherwise at least one of them ends up looking lost and bewildered. Their kerning is tightened to snug them up to one another. An italic f will collide with a following question or quote mark in some fonts, so the kerning must be opened up from the default spacing.\n\nAn ancient scribe could kern effortlessly with pen and ink, and if you read old manuscripts you'll see lots of places where a letter intrudes into the space of the one next to it. With metal type, it wasn't so easy. Kerning required cutting away some of the metal base, or table, of the character. The amount of time, skill and work involved is left as an exercise for readers whose minds are in need of a little boggling. The shapes of the letters in metal type intended for long passages of text such as books, or especially newspapers, were designed to minimize the amount of kerning that would be necessary.\n\nKerning tables built into a digital font assign preset kerning values to specific letter pairs, according to the designer's best estimate of how they should look. There can be a dozen or so pairs (or none!) in a cheapo font, thousands in a high-end one. No matter how thoroughly and well a kerning table is built, though, there will still be situations where some awkward combination requires that the kerning be loosened or tightened from the preset values of the glyphs.\n\n* Letter spacing (often “tracking” in software applications) adjusts the spacing between all the glyphs in a piece of text. This can help to make a page look a little more open and inviting, for example, especially with a similarly open leading. Very large type, such as a big headline, almost always benefits from tightening the tracking. Tiny type, such as in captions or footnotes, is made more readable by opening the letter spacing a bit, especially if the paper is absorbent and will allow the ink to spread a little.\n\nA final note: Use caution with both kerning and tracking. Tracking is very often wildly overdone, kerning is seldom done enough.",

    "original_question": "Best way to start investing, for a young person just starting their career?",
    "response": "First off, I highly recommend the book Get a Financial Life. The basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward, and this book does a great job with it. It is very light reading, and it really geared for the young person starting their career. \n\nNow, with that out of the way, there's really two kinds of \"investing\" to think about:\n\n1. Retirement (401k, IRA, SIMPLE, etc)\n2. Non-Retirement (Brokerage account, investing in individual stocks, day trading, etc)\n\nFor most individuals, it is best to take care of #1 first. Most people shouldn't even think about #2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts, established an emergency fund, and gotten their debt under control.\n\nThere are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing, both from your employer, and the government. All the more reason to take care of #1 before #2!\n\nYour employer probably offers some kind of 401k (or equivalent, like a 403b) with a company-provided match. This is a potential 100% return on your investment after the vesting period. No investment you make on your own will ever match that. Additionally, there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k. (The money you contribute doesn't count as taxable income.)\n\n***The best way to start investing is to learn about your employer's retirement plan, and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching.***\n\nBeyond this, there are also Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you can open to contribute money to on your own. You should open one of these and start contributing, but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k. The IRA won't give you that 100% ROI that the 401k will.\n\nKeep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much \"walled off\" from your day-to-day financial life. Money that goes into a retirement account generally can't be touched until retirement age, unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties. You generally don't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account.\n\nOne other thing to note: Your 401K and your IRA is an account that you put money into. Just because the money is sitting in the account doesn't necessarily mean it is invested. You put the money into this account, and then you use this money for investments. How you invest the retirement money is a topic unto itself. Here is a good starting point.",

    "original_question": "How to make a tube top?",
    "response": "Do you have some old shirts that you no longer wear? Why not turn them into a trendy tube top? If you don't have a t-shirt to spare, get some sewing elastic and stretchy fabric. With a little time and effort, you'll have a bunch of trendy tube tops to wear all summer long.\n\n## Use a shirt\n\n1. Find a t-shirt that that you don't mind cutting up, and turn it inside out. The shirt can be loose or fitted. If the shirt is loose, you will need to insert an elastic to help hold it up. If the shirt if brand new, make sure that its been washed and dried to remove any potential shrinking.\n2. Cut across the top of your shirt, just below the armpits. Try to cut through both layers of the shirt at the same time. This way, you will have to do less cutting. When you are done, discard the top part of the shirt, or save it for another project. If you are having troubles cutting straight, use a ruler or measuring tape as a guideline.\n3. Fold the cut edge down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure it with sewing pins. Make sure that you are pinning all the way around the top of the shirt; you should still be able to open the shirt, like a tube. For a nice, crisp edge, press the folded hem down with a clothing iron.\n4. Sew along the folded edge, leaving a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) gap in the back. Try to sew as close to the cut edge as you can. You will need the space between the stitching and the folded edge for the elastic. Also, make sure that you leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap between where you started and finished sewing, or you won't be able to get the elastic inside. Try to use a thread color that closely matches your t-shirt. If your sewing machine has a knit fabric setting, try to use that; it usually looks like a standard straight stitch that's broken up by V shapes. Remove the pins when you are done. Also, remember to snip off the loose ends of the threads.\n5. Measure around your chest, just below the armpits, and cut some elastic according to that measurement. This will help hold your tube top up. Even if your shirt was fitted, an elastic might still be a good idea; fitted shirts can loosen over time.\n6. Clip a safety pin to one end of the elastic, and use it to guide the through the top hem of your shirt. Find the ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap in your stitching. Push the safety pin through it, and use it to guide the elastic all the way around the top of the shirt. When you reach the gap again, pull the safety pin out. Both ends of the elastic should now be sticking out of the gap. Be careful not to lose the other end of the elastic inside the shirt hem.\n7. Sew the two ends of the elastic together. Overlap the two ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then sew them down using the smallest stitch you can. Overlapping the ends of the elastic like this will prevent any unsightly bulges. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap. Once you have the elastic back through the gap, you can sew the gap shut for a nicer finish.\n8. Wear your tube top. Be sure to wear a strapless bra with it so that you don't have any bra straps showing.\n\n\n## Make a tube top from scratch\n\n1. Measure around your bust and waist. Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to each measurement. You will need this extra width for the seam allowances.\n2. Measure from just below your armpits down to your waist. Add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to your measurement. You will need this extra length for the hems.\n3. Choose your fabric, and spread it out in front of you, wrong-side-up. The best fabric to use for a tube top is stretchy, jersey type fabric, like the kind used to make t-shirts.\n4. Draw a large rectangle according to your measurement. The top of the rectangle should equal your bust measurement. The bottom of the rectangle should equal your waist measurement. It will likely taper slightly.\n5. Fold the rectangle in half, lengthwise, with the right sides together. Secure the side edge with sewing pins. Leave the top and bottom edges alone for now. You will hem them later.\n6. Sew along the side edge using a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. Pull the pins out as you sew so that you don't accidentally prick yourself. When you are done, tie the threads off into tight knots, and snip them as close to the fabric as you can.\n7. Press the seam flat with an iron. Flatten the tube top on your ironing board, with the seam facing upward. Spread the seam allowances apart, so that they lay flat against the fabric to either side of the seam. Press them flat with a hot iron.\n8. Fold the top and bottom of your fabric down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to make the hems. Secure the folds with sewing pins, and press them flat with a clothing iron. The wrong sides of the fabric should still be facing outward at this time.\n9. Sew the top and bottom hems, but leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap on the top hem. You will need this gap to slide the elastic through. When sewing the hems, try to sew as close to the raw/cut edge as you can, so that you will have enough space for the elastic. When you are done, pull the sewing pins out. Be sure to tie the ends of the threads off into tight knots and to snip them off, as close to the fabric as you can. Try to use a stitch intended for sewing stretchy fabrics. It usually looks like a straight stitch, but is broken up by V-shapes.\n10. Measure your around chest, just below the armpits and cut a piece of elastic according to that measurement. This piece of elastic will help keep the tube top up, so make sure it is sturdy.\n11. Clip a safety pin to the elastic, and use it to feed the elastic through the top hem. Find that ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) wide gap in the top hem. Push the safety pin into the gap, then use it to feed the elastic through the hem. When you reach the gap again, unclip the safety pin. When you are done, you should have both ends of the elastic sticking out from the gap.\n12. Overlap the ends of the elastic be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and sew them down. Use the smallest stitch you can, and be careful not to sew them to the fabric. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap. At this point, you can sew the gap shut for a neater finish.\n13. Finished.\n",

    "original_question": "Why don't helicopters use reaction wheels to counter the main rotor?",
    "response": "You're talking about a device (in helicopters the tail fan imparting horizontal thrust) that counteracts the torque imparted on the main rotor (and therefore on the helicopter) by the surrounding air as the main rotor is dragged through the air.\n\nYou propose instead to impart an opposite torque through a reaction wheel. That would indeed impart an opposite torque for short lengths of time. However, you don't get a torque from spinning a reaction wheel at constant angular velocity but by changing and accelerating that angular velocity.\n\nNow the torque imparted on the helicopter by the air through the main rotor is steady - or at least its of roughly constant direction. Therefore, to counter that torque, the reaction wheel would have to accelerated uniformly and indefinitely. Clearly this is impossible from an engineering standpoint.\n\nYou can also think of this from a conservation of angular momentum, without thinking about the origin of the torques. The air imparts a steady angular impulse to the helicopter. Therefore, the helicopter system's angular momentum must increase steadily (unless there's a countering torque from the tailfan). So either that angular momentum is the spinning of the helicopter's body (which is what we're trying to avoid) or that of the reaction wheel, whose angular momentum must be steadily increasing under the action of the angular impulse to the system.",

Hugo was born on 26 February 1802, but because he was a slightly premature baby, he always believed he had been conceived on 24 June 1801. Valjean's prison number on his first incarceration at Toulon is 24601.\n-- p. 162 (emphasis mine)\n\nAs a bonus, Valjean's second prisoner number was apparently also chosen for its special significance to Hugo: it refers to the month of his daughter Léopoldine's death. From footnote 46 in Kathryn Grossman's Figuring Transcendence in Les Miserables: Hugo's Romantic Sublime:\n\nGaudon demonstrates that this image, which represents genius in one of the poet's earliest carnets (8 July 1820), is a sign of his &quot;deep identification&quot; with Valjean (Temps 547). As further evidence that the hero is an alter ego, Gohin cites the two numbers assigned to him in prison. The first, 24601, refers to the supposed date of Hugo's conception (24 June 1801), while the second, 9430, alludes to Léopoldine's death in September 1843 (&quot;Une histoire&quot; 47; see also 52).\n-- p. 165 (emphasis mine)\n",

Is there anything I can do to improve performance without reformatting the data outside of Emacs?",
    "response": "Emacs' handling of long lines is not very well optimized. For a number of operations, Emacs has to scan the whole line repeatedly. For example, to display a line, Emacs has to figure out the height of the line, which requires scanning the whole line to find the tallest glyph. Additionally, scanning for bidirectional display eats up a lot of time. You can get some additional information in, for example, the docstring of ```cache-long-line-scans``` (renamed ```cache-long-scans``` in 24.4).\n\nYou can try and see if setting ```bidi-paragraph-direction``` to ```left-to-right``` and setting ```bidi-inhibit-bpa``` (new in Emacs 27, see footnote 1) to ```t``` improves the speed for you (see footnote 2). This removes some significant contributors to line scans, but sadly not the only ones.\n\nThe best option is to add newlines. You can pipe a JSON file through e.g. ```python -c 'import json, sys ; json.dump(json.load(sys.stdin), sys.stdout, indent=2)'``` to add newlines and improve readability in general.\n\nFootnote 1: ```bidi-inhibit-bpa``` is new in Emacs 27.

Setting it to ```nil``` may improve performance, however that is an unsupported setting which may cause other problems, so it is not recommended.  In Emacs 27, the combination of setting ```bidi-paragraph-direction``` and ```bidi-inhibit-bpa``` is a supported configuration which provides approximately the same performance boost.",

    "original_question": "Why is there so much technical detail of whaling included in Moby-Dick?",
    "response": "There are multiple purposes behind the novel structure of Moby-Dick.\n\nIn the first instance the author was himself a whaleman, having spent 18 months as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler Acushnet in 1841–42. In his experience the literature of the day, such as Miriam \n\nCoffin or The Whale-Fisherman by Joseph Hart, did not portray whaling accurately but rather sensationalised it. He wished to provide his readers with a more realistic account.\n\nIn doing so, he also gave the reader the information necessary to better understand and appreciate the passages of whaling described in the novel. With the reader forewarned, he is able to keep the narrative passages tense and exciting. It is interesting that, early in the novel, the Pequod meets virutally no whales and that the chases become longer and more involved as the story progresses. This may be because Melville felt he needed to give the reader more and more technical information before they could fully appreicate these encounters, but understood the science would need to be spaced out among the narrative.\n\nIn describing it to the reader, the science also serves another useful narrative function. It indicates that on whaling voyages, long periods of time pass when nothing much happens at all. By padding out of the story with scientific digressions serves as a useful narrative metaphor for waiting.\n\nThe level of detail provided also mirrors one of the novel's central themes: obsession. Although Ishmael is the narrator and Ahab the obvious obsessive, the amount of science indicates that Ishmael is also an obsessive. His obsession is the business of whaling itself.\n\nFinally, Melville made good use of these passages in serving as metaphors for other themes of the novel where he felt it appropriate. For example in the chapter The Line, which describes how the whale line is stored and used in the boat, it ends by using the line as a metaphor.\n\n  \"All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\"\n",

While the comparison between the two players is to some extent subjective, their performances and achievements cannot be ignored. We should cherish the classic games and memories of these two players and respect their individual talents and achievements. It should also be noted that while the two players are very similar in many ways, they are also very different. Therefore, we should not compare them too much, but appreciate them for their individual characteristics and achievements.",

    "original_question": "I noticed that there is a binary executable ```/bin/echo``` on my Ubuntu MATE 17.04 system.\nI thought, that's odd, because\n```$ type echo\necho is a shell builtin```\nCursory testing suggests that ```/bin/echo``` does the same sort of thing as the Bash builtin ```echo```:\n```$ /bin/echo foo\nfoo\n$ /bin/echo $USER\nzanna\n```\nSo, why is there another version of ```echo``` separate from the Bash program, and why or when would I want to use it?",
    "response": "If you open up a ```bash``` prompt and type in an ```echo``` command, that uses a shell builtin rather than running ```/bin/echo```. The reasons it is still important for ```/bin/echo``` to exist are:\n\n* You're not always using a shell. Under a variety of circumstances, you run an executable directly and not through a shell.\n* At least in theory, some shells don't have an ```echo``` builtin.  This is not actually required.\n\nTo expand on #1, suppose you wanted to move all the regular files whose names started with ```abc``` anywhere in ```src``` to ```dest```. There are several ways to do that but one of them is:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut suppose, rather than just running that, you want to see every command that will be run first. Well, then you can prepend ```echo``` to the command, just as you might in other contexts:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec echo mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut ```find``` doesn't use a shell. That runs ```/bin/echo```.\nBesides ```find``` with ```-exec``` or ```-execdir```, the ```/bin/echo``` executable will be called by other programs that themselves run programs but not through a shell. This happens with the ```xargs``` command (which is related to ```find```), as well as in a number of other contexts, such as the ```Exec=``` line of a ```.desktop``` file. Another example is when you run ```sudo echo```, which can be handy for testing if ```sudo``` is working.\nSimilarly, some shells have a ```printf``` builtin but ```/usr/bin/printf``` also exists.\nA less common possible reason you might deliberately use ```/bin/echo``` is if you were relying on the differences between it and the ```echo``` command provided by your shell. ```man echo``` documents ```/bin/echo```; ```help echo``` in  ```bash``` documents the ```bash``` builtin. ```echo``` is not very portable, because different implementations--both across operating systems and across shells on the same operating system--support different options (e.g., ```-e```) and differ in their treatment of backslashes. Of course, it's better to avoid relying on such details, and use ```printf``` instead, which is far more portable.\nIn ```bash```, you can make the ```type``` builtin show ```/bin/echo``` as well--assuming ```/bin``` is in your ```$PATH``` as it always should be--by passing it the ```-a``` flag:\n```$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is /bin/echo\n```",

    "original_question": "I grew up in a country where we were not allowed to leave/travel to an other country even when we were able to do so – we had the resources and dual nationality.\nAfter two decades I still can't figure out why dictators, like Kim Jong-un for example, ban people from leaving their home countries?\nCould it be that a dictator is usually interested in looting the country he rules, and having a smaller population means more natural resources for him and fewer protesters?",
    "response": "People are resources, dictators (and oppressive regimes in general) don't want them to defect to other countries because they want them working for their regime. Some of them are going to be people that the regime has put their resources into, like scientists and doctors, but even laborers are valuable for actually gathering and assembling the resources the regime needs. Additionally, the regime especially does not want people with access to sensitive information to defect to their enemies. That isn't just spies and soldiers, there are plenty of \"regular\" government positions that require access to something the regime would not want falling into enemy hands, like economic data that could be used for propaganda. Obviously this is true of any country, and even in democracies with strong human rights records, people with access to classified information are usually required to submit to strict scrutiny of their international travel. Given that they aren't concerned with human rights, dictatorships can take the easier option of restricting travel to any citizens.\nHowever, defection is really a piece of a bigger issue - oppressive regimes maintain their rule in part by controlling information. Here's an interesting article that talks about how dictatorships keep power. Jerrold Post, director of the political psychology program at George Washington University, is referenced:\n\n  Post said that in both Iraq and North Korea, dictators tightly controlled the flow of information. That control was upended in the past two years during the \"Arab spring\" revolts that swept away despots in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and some of the Gulf states, revolts that were encouraged in large part by information spread by cell phones and social media. \n\nNorth Korea is probably the most extreme example of information control (according to Reporters without Borders, they are dead last in Press Freedom in the world), but this can be seen in other oppressive regimes - for example, China attempts to limit access to \"wrong\" information via its Great Firewall. This is thrown out the window if citizens go somewhere with free media and realize they are being lied to. Traveling can be the cause of their dissension, rather than a symptom.\nKnown dissidents may also be restricted from traveling so that they can not coordinate with foreign countries or anti-dictatorship organizations, and to prevent them from smuggling contraband or evidence of the regime's misinformation back into the country. Regimes can control the information originating in their country, but once someone is outside their borders the regime cannot control who they speak with.",

    "generated_instruction": "How to comfort my dog who is at the end of life?",
    "original_question": "How to comfort a dying dog?",
    "response": "Although it is a natural part of life, it is never easy saying goodbye to your beloved canine companion. During this stage of life, you will want to make your dog as comfortable as possible. The comfort you provide throughout this potentially frightening situation will make the transition easier for your dog and bring you peace of mind as well.\n\n## Comfort your dog at home\n\n1. Stay patient with your dog. Older dogs commonly begin experiencing joint and muscle problems, and they can become frustrated with their discomfort and impairments. If your dog is grumpy or irritable during the end stages of life, simply do your best to be patient and provide the other comforts you can at home.\n2. Provide a quiet environment. Chaos around the home will only stress both you and your dog as you're trying to spend the final hours of your dog's life together meaningfully and with compassion. Give your dog a quiet environment away from noisy children or other animals in the house. Soft, unobtrusive music can also be calming, or you may also use a nature soundtrack with birdsong and the sounds of running water.\n3. Speak in comforting tones. Reassure your dog that he's not alone and speak in soft comforting tones. Tell him “good boy” and the other phrases you normally use for positive reinforcement to let him know it's okay. Give him plenty of light pets as well. If you want to make sure you're there for the final moments, then you may choose to sleep next to his bed in a sleeping bag for the final nights.\n4. Put down comfortable bedding. If your dog has a favorite dog bed, put it down for him. Otherwise you can put down some other blankets to help him lay down comfortably. Your dog may also have difficulty regulating his body temperature at the end, so keep some blankets handy to put over him in the event that he shows signs of being cold. Elderly dogs are also prone to pressure sores, so put down extra cushioning for an older dog. On a practical note, he may also have problems with incontinence at the end. Choose a spot you can easily clean and bedding you can wash later. If your dog does have any accidents, then clean them up patiently without scolding him. He can't help it. If your dog gets cold, you can also use a heater in the area to make him more comfortable.\n5. Keep fresh water available. Hydration is still important to keeping your dog comfortable even in the final hours. Provide a bowl of water next to the dog bed, so your dog doesn't have to get up to drink. If your is having trouble rising even to drink, then use a clean dropper to help provide water.\n6. Prepare some of his favorite meal. If your dog has always had a favorite thing to eat, then you should make some of it in case he's hungry. However, it is pretty common for dogs to lose their appetite in the end stages of life, so don't force him to eat if he's not hungry. Solid food may also upset your dog's stomach at the end as certain systems related to digestion begin shutting down. If your dog still shows a willingness to eat but regular food is upsetting his stomach, then try mixing some baby food with water, or you can also try the Hills A/D diet, which is liquid.\n7. See your veterinarian about pain management. If your dog still has enough time and you're worried about pain in the final stages, then you can consult your vet for pain management options for the final days. Signs that your dog might be in pain include excessive panting or gasping for breath or reluctance to move.\n8. Hug your dog one final time. Once your dog passes, give him one final hug and say goodbye. It's a very painful moment, so remember that it's perfectly okay to cry, but also remember the good times you had with your pet and that he passed in a comfortable, loving environment with you doing everything you could. Be aware that some dogs seem to \"move\" or \"take a breath\" after passing away. As their nervous system shuts down, sometimes muscles in the body or lungs can spasm and look like a sign of life. It's also common for dogs to pass with their eyes open. You can close them if you want as you say your final goodbye, or you can pull one of the blankets over his head.\n9. Take care of yourself. Once your pet has passed, know that you did everything you could and worry about taking care of yourself. Seek comfort in other loved ones who understand the loss. You can also light candles or say a small prayer for your pet if it feels right and helps. The ASPCA also has a hotline you can call to talk to someone who understands the difficulty of losing a pet. You can reach this hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n10. Handle your pet's remains. Though it's unpleasant, you do have to do something with your pet's remains once he passes. Many people choose to cremate pets or bury them whether in a pet cemetery or closer to home. Many services are available to help you deal with the remains to make the process easier on you. Look online or ask your vet for services in your area that will help with the option of your choosing.\n\n\n## Comfort your dog at the vet\n\n1. Consult a professional about euthanasia. The ASPCA has a specific hotline for those dealing with the difficult decision of euthanizing a pet. The line gives you someone to talk to who will understand your grief throughout the process, as well as information about your dog's quality of life at this stage and whether or not euthanasia may be the most humane option. You can reach the ASPCA hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n2. Make the appointment. Though it hurts to do and it always feels too soon, you'll have to make an appointment for the vet to euthanize him when you know your dog is at the end of life. Your vet is likely to suggest this option if your dog's condition has significantly deteriorated and the vet believes the dog is in pain.\n3. Bring some of your dog's favorite items. You'll want to surround your dog with a few of his favorite things at the end. A favorite blanket and a soft toy are very common items that you may choose to bring with to help comfort him as he passes. Favorite blankets or a dog bed will also be much more comfortable for your dog than the exam table, especially if he's already in discomfort.\n4. Sign any forms at the vet. When you sign in for the appointment, you'll also have a few forms to fill out, including a consent form signaling that you know what is about to happen. While filling out forms is the last thing you want to focus on, it is a necessary part of the process.\n5. Ask about a sedative beforehand. If your dog is experiencing any pain or discomfort from a medical condition, ask the veterinarian about giving him a sedative. This will make your dog more comfortable, and it will give you the peace of mind later knowing that your dog passed without any pain.\n6. Pet your dog with gentle, loving strokes. Once you've been taken back to the private room and placed your dog down on his blankets with any other items, focus all your energy on spending quality final moments with him. The veterinarian will have to finish setting up the necessary items, so use this time to offer soft praise to your dog. Tell him you love him and pet him in his favorite spots.\n7. Hug your dog. Your vet will ensure you're ready and then begin injecting the solution to euthanize your dog. Many people choose to hug their dog during these moments because the process is fairly quick. Between six and twelve seconds after the solution is delivered, your dog will take a deep breath and then appear to fall into a deep sleep before taking a few more final breaths. Some pet owners also prefer not to be in the room for the actual injection and passing. The veterinarian's office is used to people who need to cope and grieve in their own ways. Ultimately decide what is right for you.\n8. Give yourself time. Do not be embarrassed to cry in front of the vet or other employees at the clinic. They all understand what you're going through. After your dog has passed away, your veterinarian will give you the option to spend some additional one-on-one time with your dog. Some owners take this opportunity to say a few last words to their dog while others choose to pass on this option.\n9. Discuss options for the remains. After giving you the time you need, your vet will discuss options concerning what to do with your dog's remains. This may include releasing them to you for burial or cremating them, which the vet can take care of. You can choose cremation either with the intent to take the cremains with you or not. In some places, it is against the law for the vet to return your pet's body to you for burial.\n",

    "original_question": "In this Creation magazine reprint of a 1994 article titled Exploding stars point to a young universe,  Young-Earth Creationist, Jonathan Sarfati argues that the scarcity of Supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sky suggests the Milky Way galaxy is less than billions of years old.\n\nOn average, a galaxy like our own, the Milky Way, should produce one supernova every 25 years.\n[...]\nAs can be readily seen above, a young universe model fits the data of the low number of observed SNRs. If the universe was really billions of years old, there are 7000 missing SNRs in our galaxy.\n\nDoes astronomy predict a Milky Way supernova every 25 years? Are there missing SNRs that undermine these predictions?",
    "response": "There are many reasons why this is wrong. The first one is the assumption of 1 supernova per 25 years. That was the value arrived at in Gustav Tammann's article published in 1970. Others got values up to 100 years (Tammann himself changed his value later). All these values are really only good guesses.\n\nWorse errors are made in the percentage of remnants that should be visible. To start with, only a small percentage of them are visible; the others are obscured by dust in the galaxy. This does not happen to the same extent to the supernovas themselves, as they are intrinsically very much brighter. \n\nSarfati also uses an old paper to come up with the number of remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way). However, that figure was considered to be wrong (and much smaller) in later studies. Older remnants are very difficult to distinguish against a background of dust in the galaxy. Many of them disappear completely after about 10,000 years or so.\n\nIt should be noted that, using Sarfati's own reasoning, we should not be able to see any remnants older than 6000 years. Instead, we know of remnants (e.g. G166.2 + 2.5) that are over 100,000 years old. How did those originate in his universe? The same goes for the distance to supernovas. The distance to SN 1987A has been trigonometrically measured at 167,000 light years (the paper says 51,200 parsecs). In other words, its light took more than 30 times longer to reach us than the creationist universe has supposedly existed. \n\nRemember also that a supernova typically becomes either a pulsar or a black hole, both of which are very hard to observe. A black hole can only be \"seen\" through its effects on other matter, and a pulsar is mainly visible if the solar system happens to be in line with its sweeping radio beam (with some pulsars the star itself has also been seen). Hence, all we can see of them long after the event is an expanding cloud of gas that gets dimmer over the millennia.\n\nThere are several other reasons which are covered in a very good article on TalkOrigins. That article has links to all the original scientific papers referred to, so you can check the validity yourself.",

    "original_question": "Why can't we kill ourselves by holding our breath?",
    "response": "## Short answer\nHealthy people cannot hold their breaths until unconsciousness sets in, let alone commit suicide.\n\n## Background\nAccording to Parkes (2005), a normal person cannot even hold their breath to unconsciousness, let alone death. Parkes says:\n\n  Breath‐holding is a voluntary act, but normal subjects appear unable\n  to breath‐hold to unconsciousness. A powerful involuntary mechanism\n  normally overrides voluntary breath‐holding and causes the breath that\n  defines the breakpoint.\n\nParkes explains that voluntary breath‐holding does not stop the central respiratory rhythm. Instead, breath holding merely suppresses its expression by voluntarily holding the chest at a certain volume. At the time of writing, no simple explanation for the break point existed. It is known to be caused by partial pressures of blood gases activating the carotid arterial chemoreceptors. They are peripheral sensory neurons that detect changes in chemical concentrations, including low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). Both hypoxia and hypercapnia are signs of breath holding and both are detected by the chemoreceptors. These receptors send nerve signals to the vasomotor center of the medulla which eventually overrides the conscious breath holding.\n\nThe breaking point can be postponed by large lung inflations, hyperoxia and hypocapnia, and it is shortened by increased metabolic rates.\n\nReference\n- Parkes, Exp Physiol (2006); 91(1): 1-15",

Or if you love talking to people, you may offer to work in a call center or go door to door to promote the non-profit organization.\n3. Give monetary donations to homeless groups and organizations. Donating money to homeless organizations can go a long way to helping with this issue. You may give a large sum once a year to a specific program for the homeless or to the organization as whole. Regular giving, where you give a small amount once weekly or once a month, can also help. Donate to a homeless organization as a gift for a friend or in memory of someone close to you. Make a holiday donation to the organization as a way to give back. Raise money for these organizations by setting up a fundraiser online for them or by asking others for donations.\n4. Go to fundraisers for homeless organizations. Show your support for ending homelessness by attending fundraisers and events that address the issue. Check your local community board for events to raise funds for a local homeless shelter or drop in center. Find out if there are fundraisers in your area that you can donate time or money to. Donate an item for a silent auction at an event for the homeless. Bid on items to help raise money for the issue. Invite friends and family to fundraisers to benefit the homeless so they can participate as well.\n5. Participate in food and clothing drives for the homeless. Donate clothing or food for the drive. Volunteer to collect food and clothing for the drive. Promote the food and clothing drive on social media to get others to donate. Warm coats, socks, scarves, and hats are all good options for a clothing drive. Non-perishable food like canned goods, crackers, and granola bars are ideal donations for a food drive. Most communities will run annual food and clothing drives, especially around Christmas time when the weather is cold and homeless people need more support. Check your community board or at your community center for information on upcoming food or clothing drives. Your school or your church may also run a food and clothing drive for the homeless.\n\n\n## Advocate for homeless policies and laws\n\n1. Write or call your government representative about ending homelessness. Many long term solutions for homelessness require changes to existing policies and laws. Contact your representative in government and ask them what they are doing to help end homelessness. Remind them that homelessness is an important issue that their constituents care about and want to address. Search online for contact information for your government representative. Calling them directly will be more effective than writing a letter. Messaging them publicly on social media can also be effective. For example, you may write to your mayor or you may contact your senator. You can also reach out to city council members to find out how they plan to address the issue. In your letter or call, advocate for more investment in affordable housing and social services to help prevent homelessness. Discuss the need for services that help homeless people find permanent homes and stay off the street. Note the need for counseling and rehabilitation centers for homeless people with addiction issues so they can get better and find employment.\n2. Support political candidates that care about ending homelessness. Put your right to vote to work by only supporting candidates who discuss ending homelessness in their platforms and during their campaigns. Promote them on social media and volunteer for their campaign. Cast your vote for them on election day. Tell friends and family about political candidates who discuss ending homelessness so they can stay informed and vote.\n3. Organize a march or protest that focuses on support for the homeless. Let others know about this important issue by organizing a march or a peaceful protest that focuses on ending homelessness. Invite friends, family members, and colleagues to the march. Promote the march or protest on social media so others can participate. Make signs that note the importance of ending homelessness and bring them to the march. Use a megaphone at the protest to give speeches about the issue. Have the march or protest in a public space, such as in front of a government building or in a public square.\n4. Work towards a career as a politician, lobbyist, or non-profit worker. Do well in your social studies and history classes in high school. Join a school debate team or public speaking club to get better at these skills. Take classes in political science, history, and conflict resolution in university. Get involved in local politics and non-profit organizations. Apply to positions as a lobbyist or a non-profit worker so you can work to actively end homelessness on a day to day basis. Run for local office with a platform that focuses on ending homelessness in your community.\n\n\n## Treat homeless people with respect\n\n1. Acknowledge the homeless person with a smile or nod. Rather than rushing by them without looking at them, make eye contact and smile or nod at them. Let them know that you see them and acknowledge them as a person. This is a small way for you to show empathy for them. Avoid yelling, shouting, or mocking the homeless person, as this will only make them feel more alienated and alone. Treat them like a friend or family member, showing care and respect for them.\n2. Try starting a conversation with the homeless person. Ask them how they are doing. Find out where they are from. Keep the conversation open and friendly. Maintain eye contact when you talk to them so they know you care. For example, you may say, “How are you today?” or “Where are you from originally?”\n\t* If the homeless person does not seem interested in answering your questions, don’t pressure them into answering. Let them decide if they want to engage with you on a deeper level.\n3. Offer to buy the homeless person a meal. If you have the time and funds, offer to grab the person a cup of coffee or a sandwich from somewhere nearby. Getting the person a warm meal may make their day and help them feel less down about their situation. The meal does not have to be elaborate or expensive. A cup of coffee or a small snack would likely be appreciated by the person.\n4. Give the homeless person a care package. Prepare a care package that contains important items like socks, warm gloves, toothpaste, lip balm, and non-perishable food like crackers or nuts. Give out the care packages to homeless people in your area so they have supplies that they need. Make it a habit to hand out care packages to homeless people once a month or regularly during the winter months.\n5. Decide to give the person money if you feel comfortable. Giving money to a homeless person is a personal preference and completely up to you. Handing change or a few bucks to a homeless person can be a demonstration of empathy and help them in a very direct way. You may decide to give the person a meal, rather than money. Or you may sometimes give the person money and offer them food other times.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "Describe, step by step, how to remove a crankshaft in a bicycle and measure the bracket.\n\nWhen measuring a bracket that is not installed on a bike, feel free to skip this section. The most common sizes for the width of the shell are 68 mm and 73 mm. You can use a ruler instead of calipers if you prefer. It’s easier to get a precise measurement with calipers though. If there is a piece of plastic sitting on top of this nut or bolt, pop it off with a flathead screwdriver. This is the dust cap. If your bracket doesn’t have a crank extractor tool or a crank bolt, it is an Italian bottom bracket. To install an Italian bottom bracket, install it by turning it counterclockwise. For an English bottom bracket, install it by turning it clockwise. To use your calipers, slide the jaws sticking out of the ruler until they’re flush against 2 surfaces. The number above the hash mark on the movable jaw is your measurement. If your spindles are not circular and have flat sides on them, you have a square-tapered bracket. This is the most common fitting type for bottom brackets and is found on basically every bicycle that isn’t vintage or custom-made.",
    "original_question": "How to measure a bottom bracket?",
    "response": "## Remove the crankshaft\n\n1. Unscrew the bolt or nut in the middle of the crankshaft. Flip your bike upside down or put it on a bike stand. Inspect the crankshaft, which is the big gear on one side of your pedals, to find how the pedal is connected to the crank. Get a socket wrench or screwdriver that fits the nut or bolt. Unscrew this piece by turning your tool counterclockwise and set it aside.Tip: If the nut or bolt is embedded in the crank wheel, use a crank extractor tool to reach the nut or bolt. Insert it into the opening and wrap it around the nut or bolt. Then, use a wrench to turn the tool counterclockwise. You cannot access or measure a bottom bracket without moving the crankshaft. If you’re measuring a bracket that is not installed on a bike, feel free to skip this section. If there is a piece of plastic sitting on top of this nut or bolt, pop it off with a flathead screwdriver. This is the dust cap. Hold the pedal arm in place while doing this to keep it from turning.\n2. Screw the crank extractor tool into the bolt in the middle of the crankshaft. Under the first nut or bolt, there will be a bolt locking the crankshaft in place. Using the threaded side of your crank extractor tool, slide your crank extractor into the opening in the crankshaft and turn it clockwise to tighten it in the threading, if necessary. On some bikes, the crankshaft won’t have any threading for a crank extractor tool. On these bikes, you can simply push the crank extractor tool into the opening and wrap it around the bolt.\n3. Tighten the socket on the open end of the crank extractor tool. With the tool attached to the nut inside of the crankshaft, turn the socket at the end of the tool clockwise by hand. Once it won’t move any further, use a wrench to turn it. Hold the pedal in place to keep the crankshaft in place. Continue turning the socket until it won’t move any further. The socket should move closer towards the crankshaft as you turn it. If it doesn’t, you’re turning the socket the wrong way. Turning this socket effectively pulls the side of the crankshaft off of the axle.\n4. Slide the crankshaft off of the bottom bracket. Once the pedal in your hand feels loose, simply slide the crank wheel off of the bottom bracket. The crank extractor tool will still be attached to the crankshaft, so turn the socket counterclockwise to remove it. With the crankshaft off, repeat this process on the other side to remove the remaining pedal. If the shaft doesn’t slide off immediately, jiggle the crankshaft a little while pulling it out. Crankshafts can stick a little if they haven’t been removed in a long time.\n\n\n## Measure the bracket\n\n1. Measure the width of the bracket’s shell using calipers. Flip the bike over or set it on a bike stand if it isn’t already. Inspect the area near your bike’s crankshaft for a horizontal cylinder that connects to your pedals. This is the shell for your bottom bracket. Spread the jaws on your calipers out and slide them around the openings on each side of the shell. Slide the movable jaw on the calipers so that they’re flush against the 2 openings of the shell. Measure your width and write down.Tip: Bottom bracket measurements are kind of confusing. For bracket dimensions, the first number is always the width of the shell. The second number is always the length of the bracket itself from spindle to spindle. Bottom bracket measurements are always taken in millimeters. The most common sizes for the width of the shell are 68 mm and 73 mm. You can use a ruler instead of calipers if you prefer. It’s easier to get a precise measurement with calipers, though. To use your calipers, slide the jaws sticking out of the ruler until they’re flush against 2 surfaces. The number above the hash mark on the movable jaw is your measurement. You can do this with the bracket installed on the bike or measure the bracket separately. You still need to measure a bracket’s bike shell though—not the bracket itself—to determine whether a bracket will fit or not.\n2. Calculate the length of the bracket from spindle to spindle. Spread the jaws of your calipers out. Wrap them around the pegs that stick out of the middle of the bracket. Close the jaws so that they’re flush with each exterior edge on your pegs. Write this measurement down after the width. This is the overall length of your bottom bracket. The length typically ranges from 113-122 mm. If you’re replacing a bottom bracket, the length of your new bracket must match the length of your old bracket. If you’re replacing the bracket and the pedals though, your bottom bracket’s length must match the required bracket length of your new pedals. The spindles are the little pegs that stick out of the bottom bracket on both sides. You can do this with the bracket installed on the bike, or measure it separately. If your spindles aren’t circular and have flat sides on them, you have a square-tapered bracket. This is the most common fitting type for bottom brackets and is found on basically every bicycle that isn’t vintage or custom-made.\n3. Check the length from edge to edge if you don’t have spindles. Some bottom brackets don’t have spindles. These brackets are called thread-through brackets. For these brackets, use your calipers to measure from the exterior edge to exterior edge. These brackets are commonly found on custom bikes and newer models.\n4. Measure the inner diameter on the side of the bracket’s shell. Spread the jaws on your calipers and wrap them around the side of the shell where the bracket is exposed on either side. Tighten the calipers around the opening to measure the diameter. Write this number down and label it. If the inner shell diameter is 1.37 inches (35 mm), you have an English bracket. This is the most common type of bottom bracket. On a BMX bike, this measurement will typically be either 19 mm or 22 mm. This measurement will be the same on both sides; don’t bother checking the width on each side. The diameter of the bottom bracket itself is irrelevant since some bottom brackets don’t sit flush on the shell. If your shell is not on the bike, you cannot determine this size without reading the instructions for the bracket.\n5. Determine what kind of bracket tool you need to check the threading. To check the threading type, you’ll need to remove the bracket from the bike. Bottom bracket tools come in different sizes based on the cup holding it in place. To determine what size bottom bracket removal tool you need, count the number of notches on the outside rim of the bracket where the cup rests. The number of notches on the bracket will match the number of notches on your bottom bracket.\n6. Remove the bottom bracket using a removal tool or wrench, if necessary. Start on the bracket on the right. Slide the bottom bracket tool over the spindle and wrap a wrench around it. Turn the bracket tool counterclockwise until the cup holding the bracket in place comes out. Repeat this process by turning the bracket tool clockwise on the left. The bottom bracket will slide right out with the cups off. If the right side won’t loosen when you turn counterclockwise, you probably have an Italian bracket. Try turning clockwise instead. If there are no threading whatsoever, you have a press-fit bottom bracket. To remove these brackets, use an old crankshaft or the head of a hammer to gently push the bracket out of the shell. Always start on the drive side of the bracket. The drive side is always on the right of the bike when you’re sitting on it.\n7. Check the threading on the bracket to see what type you have. Some shells have threading for the bottom bracket while others do not. This means that the threading on your bottom bracket must match the threading on the shell. Inspect the direction of the threading on each end of the bracket. If both sides are installed by turning counterclockwise, you have an Italian bottom bracket. If the right-hand side is installed clockwise and the left-hand side is installed counterclockwise, you have an English bracket. If there is no threading in the shell, you have a thread-together bottom bracket and you do not need to worry about threading. The English and Italian brackets are found on the vast majority of bikes. A French bracket refers to an English bracket with smaller threading.\n",

    "generated_instruction": "How would std::function be implemented?\n\nIs it the case that function::function(F f) {... } creates a new entity, or is it copied? If it is shared, how would std::function::operator() behave with multiple copies of std::function?\n\nI was surprised that copying fun object creates a new callable for fun f3 = f1; so for fun fun f1 = [=]() mutable { std::cout << value++ << '\\n' }; fun f2 = f1; fun f3 = f1; where f2 is copied and not shared, f1 gets incremented three times (two increments in f1 + one additional increment to f2's copy)",
    "original_question": "According to the sources I have found, a lambda expression is essentially implemented by the compiler creating a class with overloaded function call operator and the referenced variables as members. This suggests that the size of lambda expressions varies, and given enough references variables that size can be arbitrarily large.\nAn ```std::function``` should have a fixed size, but it must be able to wrap any kind of callables, including any lambdas of the same kind. How is it implemented? If ```std::function``` internally uses a pointer to its target, then what happens, when the ```std::function``` instance is copied or moved? Are there any heap allocations involved?",
    "response": "The implementation of ```std::function``` can differ from one implementation to another, but the core idea is that it uses type-erasure. While there are multiple ways of doing it, you can imagine a trivial (not optimal) solution could be like this (simplified for the specific case of ```std::function<int (double)>``` for the sake of simplicity):\n```struct callable_base {\n   virtual int operator()(double d) = 0;\n   virtual ~callable_base() {}\n};\ntemplate <typename F>\nstruct callable : callable_base {\n   F functor;\n   callable(F functor) : functor(functor) {}\n   virtual int operator()(double d) { return functor(d); }\n};\nclass function_int_double {\n   std::unique_ptr<callable_base> c;\npublic:\n   template <typename F>\n   function(F f) {\n      c.reset(new callable<F>(f));\n   }\n   int operator()(double d) { return c(d); }\n// ...\n};\n```\nIn this simple approach the ```function``` object would store just a ```unique_ptr``` to a base type. For each different functor used with the ```function```, a new type derived from the base is created and an object of that type instantiated dynamically. The ```std::function``` object is always of the same size and will allocate space as needed for the different functors in the heap.\nIn real life there are different optimizations that provide performance advantages but would complicate the answer. The type could use small object optimizations, the dynamic dispatch can be replaced by a free-function pointer that takes the functor as argument to avoid one level of indirection, but the idea is basically the same.\n\nRegarding the issue of how copies of the ```std::function``` behave, a quick test indicates that copies of the internal callable object are done, rather than sharing the state.\n```// g++4.8\nint main() {\n   int value = 5;\n   typedef std::function<void()> fun;\n   fun f1 = [=]() mutable { std::cout << value++ << '\\n' };\n   fun f2 = f1;\n   f1();                    // prints 5\n   fun f3 = f1;\n   f2();                    // prints 5\n   f3();                    // prints 6 (copy after first increment)\n}\n```\nThe test indicates that ```f2``` gets a copy of the callable entity, rather than a reference. If the callable entity was shared by the different ```std::function<>``` objects, the output of the program would have been 5, 6, 7.",

    "generated_instruction": "What is the syntax for using brackets to cut parts of arrays or tuples in python?",
    "original_question": "How slicing in Python works? Please include references where appropriate.",
    "response": "The syntax is:\n\n```\na[start:stop]  # items start through stop-1\na[start:]      # items start through the rest of the array\na[:stop]       # items from the beginning through stop-1\na[:]           # a copy of the whole array\n```\n\nThere is also the `step` value, which can be used with any of the above:\n```\na[start:stop:step] # start through not past stop, by step\n```\nThe key point to remember is that the `:stop` value represents the first value that is not in the selected slice. So, the difference between `stop` and `start` is the number of elements selected (if `step` is 1, the default).\n\nThe other feature is that `start` or `stop` may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:\n```\na[-1]    # last item in the array\na[-2:]   # last two items in the array\na[:-2]   # everything except the last two items\n```\nSimilarly, `step` may be a negative number:\n```\na[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed\na[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed\na[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed\na[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed\n```\n\nPython is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than you ask for. For example, if you ask for ```a[:-2]``` and ```a``` only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error. Sometimes you would prefer the error, so you have to be aware that this may happen.\n\n## Relationship with the ```slice``` object\n\nA slice object can represent a slicing operation, i.e.:\n```\na[start:stop:step]\n```\nis equivalent to:\n```\na[slice(start, stop, step)]\n```\n\nSlice objects also behave slightly differently depending on the number of arguments, similarly to ```range()```, i.e. both ```slice(stop)``` and ```slice(start, stop[, step])``` are supported. To skip specifying a given argument, one might use ```None```, so that e.g. ```a[start:]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(start, None)]``` or ```a[::-1]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(None, None, -1)]```.\n\nWhile the ```:```-based notation is very helpful for simple slicing, the explicit use of ```slice()``` objects simplifies the programmatic generation of slicing.",

Let her know that it's okay to be sad or upset about leaving her old school and starting at a new one. Let her know that it's okay to feel excited too! \n* Find out what is bothering her, and then help her to find ways to cope. Talking with her teachers may give you some clues, as they may have noticed her acting out in class and can offer suggestions as well.\n* Encourage her to make friends. Remind her that making friends is a skill that can be learned. Talk about ways that she can meet new people, like joining an after-school club or asking a classmate to go to lunch with her. \n* Encourage her to explore her new school. Help her to make a list of the different areas of the school, like the playground, cafeteria, and library. Ask her if she would like to explore the school with you during her lunch break or after school. \n* Encourage her to take responsibility. Try to give her more responsibilities at home. Let her help you to make meals, do the dishes, or fold laundry. Let her know that you trust her to do these things. This will help to build her confidence and sense of responsibility, which will help her to feel more comfortable at school.\n\nThe most important thing that you can do is to let her know that you are there for her if she needs you. Give her some space though, and don't pressure her into opening up if she doesn't want to.",
